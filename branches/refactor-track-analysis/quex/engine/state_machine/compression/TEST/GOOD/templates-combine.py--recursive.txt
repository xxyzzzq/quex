Involved states in First = 1L
Involved states in Second = 2L
=> when First triggers to 1L and Second to 2L, then both
   are recursive and no distinction needs to be made.

(Straight)---------------------------------------

|         |                            |    1, 2;
|                                      |    2;

|         |                            |    -2, 2;

(Vice Versa)-------------------------------------

|                                      |    2;
|         |                            |    1, 2;

|         |                            |    -2, 2;

(1L, 2L) has not to appear, but '-2' to indicate recursion.
