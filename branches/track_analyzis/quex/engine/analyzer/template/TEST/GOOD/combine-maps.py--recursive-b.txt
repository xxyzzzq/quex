Involved states in First = 1L
Involved states in Second = 2L
=> when First triggers to 1L and Second to 2L, then both
   are recursive and no distinction needs to be made.
BUT: HERE STATE ENTRIES ARE NOT UNIFORM --> NO RECURSION DETECTION

|         |                            |    1, 2;
|                                      |    2;

BorderN    = 1
TargetComb = (1L, 2L)

(Vice Versa)-------------------------------------

|                                      |    2;
|         |                            |    1, 2;

BorderN    = 1
TargetComb = (2L, 1L)
