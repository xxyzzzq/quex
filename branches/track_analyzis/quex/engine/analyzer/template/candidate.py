If two states with non-uniform frames (entries and drop-outs) are 
to be combined, then this requires extra effort. Consider the following
case:

        ENTRY0:                       ENTRY1:
           pos[12] = input_p             pos[0] = input_p
           pos[5]  = input_p          
                                      
        MAP:                          MAP:
           ... recurse -> ENTRY0         ... recurse --> ENTRY1
           ... reload(ENTRY0, DROP0)     ... reload(ENTRY1, DROP1)
                                      
        DROP0:                        DROP1:
           goto TERMINAL_15;             goto TERMINAL_FAILURE;

Both states differ in the way they are entered, and the way that they
are dropped out. Consequently, the reload procedure differs, too. The
entries are still be routed by the label, RELOAD and DROP-OUT procedures
are identified by the template key (given at entry). A combination may
look like:

        ENTRY0:
           template_key = 1
        ENTRY0_intern:
           pos[12] = input_p
           pos[5]  = input_p
           acceptance_id = 16;
           goto MAP;

        ENTRY1:
           template_key = 2
        ENTRY1_intern:
           pos[0] = input_p
           goto MAP;

        MAP:
           input_p++;
           ... recurse:
               -- simply: if all recursive states do not change position storage.
               goto MAP; 
               -- or:
               switch( template_key ) {
               case 1: RELOAD(ENTRY0_intern, DROP);
               case 2: RELOAD(ENTRY1_intern, DROP);
               }
           ... reload:
               switch( template_key ) {
               case 1: RELOAD(ENTRY0_intern, DROP);
               case 2: RELOAD(ENTRY1_intern, DROP);
               }

        DROP:
           switch( template_key ) {
           case 1: goto TERMINAL_15;
           case 2: goto FAILURE;
           }
    
This file contains functions that compute the 'gain' (= - 'cost') when two
states (one or both of them may be template states) are combined. There is no
reason to give a template state a 'weight' corresponding to the number of state
it combines. At this point in time, both considered states are already 'states'
and we only want to find out what is getting better (if actually) in case both
are combined.
