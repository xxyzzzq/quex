This section has shown how to built a lexical analyser with quex and
provided a ready-to-run sample application. It was discussed how to specify
patterns in a pattern file, how to announce names for token-identifiers and how
to code mode-files that contain information about modes and pattern-action
pairs. After an explanation of how to invoque quex, a sample application was
discussed that uses the created lexical analyser engine. The Makefile that
comes with the example can be easily adapted to particular applications and
reduces the required effort to the typing of `make` on the command line.
In general, the example files `simple.qx` and `lexer.cpp` build a good
basis for a new project. In the following chapters various features and options
of quex are discussed. Additionally some discussion will be made about the
    generated lexical analyser.  The current chapter provided enough
	information to start coding a lexical analyzer. Following chapters
	become interesting once you tasted the ease of quex.
