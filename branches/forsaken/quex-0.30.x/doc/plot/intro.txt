Since version 0.21.11, quex has the ability to produce transition
graphs for the state machines that result from the regular expressions
of its modes. This happens with help of the tool 'graphviz' from AT\&T
Labs (http://www.graphviz.org). Please, install this package before
any attempt to produce transition graphs. 

The plot of transition graphs is initiated with the command line argument
`--plot` followed by a string that indicates the graphic format, e.g.

[shell]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
> quex -i core.qx --plot svg
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

will produce transition graphs of all state machines that would result from
descriptions in `core.qx`. As a result of this operation a set of files is
created that carry the extension of the graphic format. The basenames of the
files are related to the mode from which its content results. A list of
supported graphic formats can be queried by passing the command line argument
`--plot-format-list`.
