This chapter discussed the major features of quex. To the knowledge of the
author of this text, at the time of this writing, there is no lexical analyser
generator that matches these features. Moreover, once one gets used to think
in terms of 'sending tokens', 'mode-transitions', and once one gets used to
define modes that implement standard behavior for other modes using
inheritance, then it becomes hard to get back to the cumbersome thinking of
plain lex or flex. The little overhead required to learn new concepts comes
with the great advantage of being able to design the lexical analysis process
in a very natural way footnote:[Well, at least 'natural' to the author of this
  text.].
