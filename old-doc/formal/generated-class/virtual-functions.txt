The generated lexical analyser contains also virtual functions that do not do
anything but wait for being overriden by a derived class. Those functions are

[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   void   on_action_entry(const char* Pattern, const int Length); 
   void   on_include(const char* Filename);
   void   on_include_exit();
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Function {\tt on\_action\_entry(...)} allows to write a user defined function
that is executed whenever a pattern matches. The last two functions are
executed at the moment when a file is included or one returns from an included 
file. The default implementation is that they do not do anything. Only if one
derives a class from the lexical analyser, then one creates its own 
handlers for these events. If you do not want to use these functions 
at all, you are free to outcomment the definition
