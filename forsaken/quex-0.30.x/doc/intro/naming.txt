The name quex has obviously a lexo-graphical relation to lex and flex--the most
known tools for generating lexical analysers at the time of this writing.  The
'Qu' at the beginning of the word stands for 'quick', so hopefully the new
features of quex and the ability to created directly coded engines will
generate much faster lexical analysers. Also, the process of programming shall
be much quicker by means of handy shortcuts that quex provides and the elegance that
problems can be solved. 

The last letter 'χ' is a the greek lowercase letter 'chi'.  It
is intended to remind the author of this text that he actually wanted to create
a better \TeX footnote:[As Donald Knuth explains it\cite{}, the last letter in
\TeX is an uppercase 'chi' so the name is to be pronounced like the German word
'ach' (it's actually more a sound Germans utter, rather than a word with a
       dedicated meaning). Analogously, the χ at the end of quex should
not be pronounced like the 'x' of the German word 'nix'.] system with optimized
source code appearance. When he realized that traditional lexical analysers did
not provide the functionality to express solutions easily he started working on
quex--and dived into the subject much deeper than he ever thought he would.
