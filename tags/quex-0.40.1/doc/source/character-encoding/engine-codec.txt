Analyzer Engine Codec
=====================

Apapting the internal codec of the generated lexical analyzer engine happens by
means of the command line flag ``--codec``. When a codec is specified the
internal engine will no longer run on unicode, but rather on the specified
codec. Consider the example of a lexical analyzer definition for some greek
text to be encoded in ISO-8859-7:

.. code-block:: cpp

    define {
        CAPITAL   [ΆΈΉΊΌΎ-Ϋ]   
        LOWERCASE [ά-ώ]
        NUMBER    [0-9][0-9.,]+
    }

    mode X :
    <skip: [ \t\n]>
    {
        {CAPITAL}{LOWERCASE}+  => QUEX_TKN_WORD(Lexeme);
        {NUMBER}               => QUEX_TKN_NUMBER(Lexeme);
        km2|"%"|{LOWERCASE}+   => QUEX_TKN_UNIT(Lexeme);
    }

The resulting state machine in Unicode is shown in 
Figure :ref:`Unicode Engine <fig-codec-unicode>`. This engine could 
either fed by converted file content using a converting buffer filler. 
Alternatively, it can be converted so that it directly parses ISO8859-7
encoded characters. Specifying on the command line::

   > quex (...) --codec iso8859_7 (...)

does the job. 

.. _fig-codec-unicode:

.. figure:: ../figures/state-machine-codec-unicode.*
   
   Sample lexical analyzer with an internal engine codec 'Unicode'.

The result is a converted state machine as shown in figure
:ref:`ISO8859-7 Eninge <fig-codec-iso8859-7>`. that the state machine
basically remains the same, only the transition rules have been adapted.

.. _fig-codec-iso8859-7:

.. figure:: ../figures/state-machine-codec-iso8859-7.*

   Sample lexical analyzer with an internal engine codec 'ISO8859-7' (greek).

It is worth mentioning that the command line arguments ``--codec-info`` providing
information about the list of codecs and ``--codec-for-language`` are usefule
for making decisions about what codec to choose.
