Promoting Quex
--------------

Quex is a lexical analyzer generator that is produces directly coded engines.
Those engines are much faster than flex generated engines, and even faster than
hand written analyzers. Indeed, one of the goals of the quex project is to
provide a tool to provide ultra fast lexical analysis-which is still the
bottleneck of many compilers. 

Since the guys around the quex project are busy with their own developments
they have little time to promote the project in common-place media. Anyone who
would like to write an article in Linux journal or other OpenSource magazines
will be strongly supported.

Any motivated individual is welcome to contribute. For first contact, please
also consider the audio conference (Quex Cafee http://quex.sourceforge.net/QuexCafe.html).

Best Regards

Frank-Rene Schaefer
(Project Administrator of Quex)
