Benchmark Tests for Quex
------------------------

Quex is a lexical analyzer generator that is produces directly coded engines.
Those engines are much faster than flex generated engines, and even faster than
hand written analyzers. Indeed, one of the goals of the quex project is to
provide a tool to provide ultra fast lexical analysis-which is still the
bottleneck of many compilers. 

The author of quex has already implemented a benchmark suite (a quex based lexical
analyzer for 'C'). This suite shall be used to:

-- trace the improvements of quex during development.
-- compare quex to others (re2c, ragel, flex, etc.)
-- compare different cpus and operating systems.

Interesting points would also be the investigation of cache-issues on performance and
strategic code placement based on statistics.

Any motivated individual is welcome to contribute. For first contact, please
also consider the audio conference (Quex Cafee http://quex.sourceforge.net/QuexCafe.html).
