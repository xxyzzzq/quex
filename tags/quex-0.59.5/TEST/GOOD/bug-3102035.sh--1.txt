## In this test we try to avoid issues with some 'weird' cases that
## produced duplicate state labels. The the compiler warnings such as
## 
##   Case3.c:154: error: duplicate label ‘STATE_39’
##   Case3.c:151: error: previous definition of ‘STATE_39’ was here
##
## would appear. If they do not, then everything is fine.
