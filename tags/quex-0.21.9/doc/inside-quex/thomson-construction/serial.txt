Mounting two state machines together in sequence is fairly
simple. If state machine B is to be mounted after state machine
A, then the following is to be done:


-  Clone both state machines, to make sure that we have unique
      state-ids inside the two machines, and operations won't 
      influence the originals A and B.
-  Mount an epsilon transition from all acceptance states of A
      to the initial state of B.
-  Disable acceptance of all acceptance states in A.
-  Collect all states of A and B into a single state machine.

These steps imply that the acceptance state of the last state machine
remains. In Quex an algorithm is implemented that does the sequentialization
for any number of state machines---not just two---in one beat.
In figure <<fig:mount-sequential, style=ref>> a state machine is created representing
a 'matcher' for floating point numbers out of the sequentialized patterns
$$[0-9]+$$, a dot '$$.$$', and $$[0-9]+$$}.
