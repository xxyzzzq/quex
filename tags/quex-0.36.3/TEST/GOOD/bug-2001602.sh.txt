## You are running a lexical analyser generated by quex in 'paranoid' mode.
## This is very good, in a way that any tiny misbehavior will cause a comment
## and a program exit. However, the paranoia is a heavy load on speed performance!
## To disable it, please, compile with the following compile option:
## "-DQUEX_OPTION_ASSERTS_DISABLED".
## The lexical analyser is very low-level and the smallest error
## can have desastrous consequences. Leaving the asserts helps you to find subtle
## errors in your code--and if you find one in the lexical analyser, then please,
## report it at http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=168259&atid=846112
