Tests in this directory test the state machine examination.  The procedure and
its rationale is described in 00-README.txt and the other text files. The
examination is controlled by a class derived from 'Recipe'. There are two types
of tests:

(1) General Tests

    Those test rely on 'TestRecipe' which serves as a placeholder for real
    investigated behavior. 
    
    File name pattern: 'g-*.py'.

(2) Applied Recipe Tests.

    Those tests check for the application of the procedure to a particular
    investigated behavior. They use a real existing derived class of
    'Recipe'.  
    
    File name pattern: 'x-*.py' where 'x' is the name of the investigated
    behavior.
