(*) 'char' and 'wstring'

test.qx:2:warning: The implemented token type does not have a member which can
test.qx:2:warning: directly accept a QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER pointer, i.e like
test.qx:2:warning: 
test.qx:2:warning:     content : const QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN*;
test.qx:2:warning: 
test.qx:2:warning: or 
test.qx:2:warning: 
test.qx:2:warning:     content : std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN>;
test.qx:2:warning: 
test.qx:2:warning: This means, that you might not be able to pass the 'Lexeme' 
test.qx:2:warning: to a token constructor. To disable this warning set one of 
test.qx:2:warning: the command line flag:
test.qx:2:warning: 
test.qx:2:warning:     '--token-type-no-stringless-check' or '--ttnsc'.
test.qx:2:warning: 
test.qx:2:warning: Note, that the stringless check is not perfect and is not
test.qx:2:warning: aware of the conversions and constructors of all the member
test.qx:2:warning: types. If you are sure that one of your members can receive
test.qx:2:warning: the QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER pointer through a conversion
test.qx:2:warning: operator or a constructor, please, disable this warning 
test.qx:2:warning: as mentioned above.
test.qx:2:warning: 
test.qx:2:warning: In any case: If you can compile generated code dispite of
test.qx:2:warning: this warning you can set the command line flags above. The
test.qx:2:warning: fact that it compiles is prove enough that such a member
test.qx:2:warning: exists.
test.qx:2:warning: 
command line: The 'Accumulator' feature is activated, which mandatorily
command line: requires such a member as mentioned above. Please, do one of
command line: the following:
command line: 
command line: -- deactivate the stringless check as mentioned above, if
command line:    you are sure that the stringless check missed something.
command line: 
command line: -- deactivate the accumulator feature using command line options:
command line:    '--no-string-accumulator' or  '--nsacc'.
command line: 
command line: -- specify at least one member in the token class that can 
command line:    receive a QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER pointer.
