As mentioned in the section \ref{sec:philosophie}, the quex program was
earlier part of a project for creating a programming language with optimized
source code appearance {\SaferTeX}\cite{}. The key idea was to allow

understand certain things from context. This led to the concept of {\it
  implicit tokens}. Also dedicated mini-sub-languages, such as for the parsing
of table content imposed the support of sophisticated {\it lexical analysis
  modes}. Finally, concepts such a line and column numbering are provided.
The following list gives an overview about the features of quex:
