Web Page Design for Quex
------------------------

Quex is a lexical analyzer generator that is produces directly coded engines.
Those engines are much faster than flex generated engines, and even faster than
hand written analyzers. Indeed, one of the goals of the quex project is to
provide a tool to provide ultra fast lexical analysis-which is still the
bottleneck of many compilers. 

Unfortunately, the author of the project is not very familiar with html and the
like. Here, heavy aid is needed in order to get the web-site spruced up a bit.
Goals would be to have a CMS (or at least some CSS driven system) to implement
documentation, news, about-pages, and a benchmark display. 

Any motivated individual is welcome to contribute. For first contact, please
also consider the audio conference (Quex Cafee http://quex.sourceforge.net/QuexCafe.html).
