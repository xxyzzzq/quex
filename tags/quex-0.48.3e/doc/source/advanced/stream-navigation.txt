Stream Navigation
=================

Independent of the underlying character encoding :ref:`sec-character-encodings`
quex's generated lexical analyzers allow for a stream navigation on character
basis. All required mechanisms of buffer loading and stream positioning
is taking care of in the background. The interface for character index based
stream navigation consists of the following member functions.

.. code-block:: cpp

    size_t  tell();
    void    seek(const size_t CharacterIndex);
    void    move_forward(const size_t CharacterIndex);
    void    move_backward(const size_t CharacterIndex);

The ``tell()`` function reports the current character index where the lexical analyzer
is going to continue its next step. With the ``seek(...)`` function the character
index can be specified where the analyzis is to be continued. By means of ``move_forward(...)``
and ``move_backward(...)`` the input is adapted relative to the current character index.
