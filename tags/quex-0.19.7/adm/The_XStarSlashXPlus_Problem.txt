Ideas for the solution of the x*/x+ Problem:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem encloses a family of Regular Expressions:

          x* / x{n.m} 
          x* / x{n}
          x* / x{n,}

Basic Problem:

          -- State Machine needs to count and to stack old positions and decide
             at the end to which position to reset the input pointer. 

          -- The 'dangerous' branches of the state machine need to be extracted
             from the state machine's core and post condition.


IDEA: Go backwards the inverse post condition. I.e create an inverted
      post condition and then go along.
