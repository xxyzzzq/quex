Mode Transitions
================

The transition from one mode to another can be controlled via the commands ``GOTO``, 
``GOSUB``, and ``GOUP``. Consider an example of usage of ``GOTO`` for mode transitions:

.. code-block:: cpp

    mode NORMAL {
        "<" => GOTO(TAG);
        .   => QUEX_TKN_LETTER(Lexeme);
        
    }
    mode TAG {
        ">" => GOTO(NORMAL);
        .   => QUEX_TKN_LETTER(Lexeme);
    }

There are two modes ``NORMAL`` and ``TAG``. As soon as an opening ``<`` arrives
the analyzer transits from ``NORMAL`` mode to ``TAG`` mode. As soon as the
closing ``>`` arrives, the analyzer transits back to ``NORMAL`` mode.
Additionally to the mode transition, tokens can be sent if more arguments are
added. If it is required to send tokens for the tag regions, the above example
may be extended as follows

.. code-block:: cpp

    mode NORMAL {
        "<" => GOTO(TAG, QUEX_TKN_OPEN_TAG);
        .   => QUEX_TKN_LETTER(Lexeme);
        
    }
    mode TAG {
        ">" => GOTO(NORMAL, QUEX_TKN_CLOSE_TAG);
        .   => QUEX_TKN_LETTER(Lexeme);
    }

Now, when transitions from and to the ``TAG`` mode are triggered, also tokens
are produced with the token-ids ``QUEX_TKN_OPEN_TAG`` and ``QUEX_TKN_CLOSE_TAG``.
Additional arguments, such as the ``Lexeme`` can be passed analogously to the 
normal token sendings.

In case that one enters a mode from different other modes, the use of the mode
stack comes handy. Imagine a mode ``FORMAT_STRING`` for parsing ANSI-C-like
format strings. Now, those format strings may occur in a ``PROGRAM`` mode and
in a ``MATH`` mode. If ``GOSUB`` is used instead of ``GOTO`` then the engine
remembers the previous mode. The next ``GOUP`` triggers a transition to this
previous mode. Theoretically, the depth of sub-modes is only restricted by the
computer's memory. Practically, using a depth of more than two risks to 
end up in confusing mode transition behavior. In this cases the use
of mode transition restrictions <<sec mode-options>> becomes a useful tool
in order to detect undesired mode changes.

.. code-block:: cpp

    mode PROGRAM {
        ...
        \"         => GOSUB(FORMAT_STRING,  QUEX_TKN_OPEN_STRING);
        ...
    }

    mode MATH {
        ...
        \"         => GOSUB(FORMAT_STRING, QUEX_TKN_OPEN_STRING);
        ...
    }

    mode FORMAT_STRING {
        ...
        \"         => GOUP(QUEX_TKN_CLOSE_STRING);
        ...
    }

As with ``GOTO`` additional arguments indicate a token sending. Those
arguments are applied on the constructor for the resulting token.
