The design of modes, their relations and the transitions is something 
to be done informally with a drawing program or on a sheet of paper.
It is basically a help for the user to develop a clear design of the lexical
analysis process. In our simple example, there are only three modes:

`END_OF_FILE`:: 
 
  This mode describes the reaction to end-of-file.
  All modes in the simple example share this behavior, so they are derived
  from this mode. On the other hand, this is more an _abstract_
  mode\footnote{In the C++ sense of the word, there is no 'real' existing mode
  of that type. Only derived modes can exists.}. The lexical analyser shall
  never be in an `END\_OF\_FILE` mode, but in a derived mode of it.
  
`PROGRAM`:: 

  In this mode, we detect program related tokens. It is
  derived from `END\_OF\_FILE`. Thus, an if an end-of-file arrives in this
  mode it behaves propperly. When a string delimiter arrives, this mode shall
  transit into the `STRING\_READER` mode.
  
`STRING\_READER`:: 
  
  This mode shall also treat end-of-file in the
  'standard' way, so it is also derived from `END\_OF\_FILE`. However,
  all patterns for number detection, keywords and brackets are totally
  meaningless inside the string. A string-delimiter shall trigger the return
  to the `PROGRAM` mode.

The inheritance relationships in this example are displayed in figure
<<fig:inheritance-modes, style=ref>>. Both 'real' modes `PROGRAM` and` 
  STRING_READER` are derived from `END_OF_FILE` so that they implement
the standard behavior for the end-of-file event.

In this examples their are only two modes in which the lexical analyser can
be. The posible transitions are shown in figure
<<fig:mode-transition-example.png, style=ref>>. `PROGRAM` mode can transit into
`STRING_READER` mode and vice versa. The mode inheritances and
transitions are only pinpointed in non-machine readable form.  This
information can be used to write the first stubs of the modes in
which one will later fill in the pattern-action pairs.

.Example code stubs for lexical analyser modes.
[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mode END_OF_FILE :
<inheritable: only>  
{
...
}

mode PROGRAM :
     END_OF_FILE
<exit:  STRING_READER>
<entry: STRING_READER>
{
...
}

mode STRING_READER :
     END_OF_FILE
<exit:  PROGRAM>
<entry: PROGRAM>
{
...
}
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The three code-stubs for the three modes are shown in figure
<<fig:example-mode-stubs, style=ref>>. Until now, there are no pattern action pairs
defined inside the modes. The dots `...` inside the curly braces will
later be replaced by the pattern-action pairs. First of all, mode `END_OF_FILE` 
is defined. It does not inherit any mode, but can only be
used as a base mode. Thus the option 

[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <inheritable: only> 
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

is specified in edgy brackets.  Second, the `PROGRAM` mode is 
derived from `END\_OF\_FILE` which is
indicated by its name following the colon. The options 

[cpp]
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    <exit:  STRING_READER> 
    <entry: STRING_READER> 
source~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

tell that this mode can
be entered from `STRING\_READER` mode, and that it can exit to this mode.
Any transition to another mode (that is not derived from `STRING\_READER`)
is detected as an error\footnote{Note, that inside quex `assert()`
  commands are used. According to ISO9899 (ANSI-C) the command only takes
  effect, if `NDEBUG` is not defined. If it is, the mode transitions are
  consequently not checked by the quex engine. The general rule applies here
  also: only define `NDEBUG` if it is 100\% safe to say that no use-case
  will violate the design.}. Analogously, the `STRING\_READER` mode is
defined specifying its base class and the allowed transitions to `PROGRAM`.

Note, that all options given here are indeed _optional_.  They are not
necessary to define pattern-action pairs, and they do not contribute to the
functioning of the generated lexical analyser. However, they allow to check
wether mode definitions and mode transitions are according to the design or
not. The detection of usage against design specifications is of great help to
avoid errors or find their causes.
