There are exactly two events that are related to mode transitions: entering
and exiting. Accordingly, one can define inside a mode the two handlers` 
on\_entry` and `on\_exit`. In addition to the `self` reference, the
following variables are available:

`const quex\_mode& FromMode`:: 

  Only availabe in `on\_entry` where this is the mode _from_ which the current
  mode is entered.

`const quex\_mode& ToMode`:: 

  Only availabe in `on\_exit` where this is the mode _to_ which the lexical
  analyser transits.

The `on\_exit` function of the mode that is left is always called before
the `on\_entry` function of the mode that is entered. Note, that it does
not make sense inside transitions to use the `RETURN` statement since at
this point the token-queue is not to be synchronized with a user's token
request. Examples for enter and exit handlers have been given in section
\ref{sec:practical/pattern-action-pairs}.
