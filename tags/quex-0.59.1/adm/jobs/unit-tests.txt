Unit Tests for Quex
-------------------

Quex is a lexical analyzer generator that is produces directly coded engines.
Those engines are much faster than flex generated engines, and even faster than
hand written analyzers. Indeed, one of the goals of the quex project is to
provide a tool to provide ultra fast lexical analysis-which is still the
bottleneck of many compilers. 

Quex is a program that has a high level of inter-dependencies between modules.
In order to preserve stability, a large set of unit tests is provided that 
helps to assure robustness for each release. The author of quex would appreciate
the help of an 'evil' spectator who investigates the coverage and content of 
the unit tests, finds weaknesses and even writes his own unit tests.

Any motivated individual is welcome to contribute. For first contact, please
also consider the audio conference (Quex Cafee http://quex.sourceforge.net/QuexCafe.html).
