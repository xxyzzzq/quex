Lexical analysis is all about patterns. The following section recalls some
basics on the mechanisms of pattern matching. For a detailed description see
\cite{}, \cite{}, and \cite{}. It also explains how tokens are communicated to
the caller of the lexical analyzer.  Further, it introduces the quex's
concept of lexical analyzer modes.  Eventually, a final section explains the
control and handling of mode transitions.
