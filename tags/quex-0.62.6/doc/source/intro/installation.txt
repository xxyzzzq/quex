Installation
============

On sourceforge there are a variety of Quex packages supporting
the major operating systems and distributions at the time of this
writing as they are: Microsoft Windows (tm), Mac OS (tm), and Linux
(.deb and .rpm based distributions).

This section discusses the major 'pillars' of an installation. It is
explains how to install quex from one of the source packages on
an arbitrary platform. At the same time, it may provide first hints
for troubleshooting. The pillars of a Quex installation are the 
following:

.. describe:: Python

    Before beginning the installation of quex, make sure that
    Python (http://www.python.org) is installed. Most linux distributions provide
    handy .rpm or .deb packages.

    .. warning:: 

       Do not install a Python version >= 3.0! Python 3.x is a language
       different from Python < 3.0. Quex is programmed towards version
       2.6.

    In order to verify that Python is installed you may open a 
    console (``cmd.exe``, ``xterm`` or a shel/terminal under Unix).
    Then type ``python`` and the output should be similar to::

        > python
        Python 2.6.4 (r264:75706, Jan 30 2010, 22:50:05) 
        ...
        >>> 

    Type ``quit()`` to leave the shell. If you do not get this interactive
    python shell, then most likely the PATH variable does not contain 
    the path where Python is installed. On the console review the setting
    of the PATH by::

        C:\> echo %PATH%

    on Windows, or::

        > echo $PATH

    on Unix. If Python's path is not in the list, then add it. Consult your
    the documentation of your operating system for further instructions
    about how to do this.

.. describe:: Quex Distribution

   Get a source distribution from ``quex.org`` or ``quex.sourceforge.net``.
   That is, select a file with the ending '.tgz', '.zip', or '.7z' from the
   download directory.  Extract the files to a directory of your choice.

.. describe:: The QUEX_PATH

   Quex knows about where it is installed through the environment variable
   ``QUEX_PATH``. If you are using a Unix system and the bash-shell, add 
   the following line to your ``.bashrc``-file::
  
       export QUEX_PATH=the/directory/where/quex/was/installed/

   To do the same thing on Windows, go to Control Panel, System, Advanced,
   Environment Variables. Then add the variable ``QUEX_PATH`` with the
   value ``C:\Programs\Quex``, provided that quex is installed there.

   For clarity, the path must point to the place wher ``quex-exe.py`` 
   is located.

.. describe:: The Quex Executable

   The safest way to do this is to add the content of the ``QUEX_PATH``
   variable to the PATH variable. Thus the systems will search for
   executables in quex's installation directory. Or, on operating systems
   that can provide links, make a link::
   
      > ln -s $QUEX_PATH/quex-exe.py $EXECUTABLE_PATH/quex
     
   where ``$EXECUTABLE_PATH`` is a path where executables can be found by 
   your system.  On a Unix system an appropriate directory is::
   
           /usr/local/bin/quex 
           
   To access this directory, you should be either root or use ``sudo``. 
   You can ensure executable rights with::
       
      > chmod a+rx $QUEX_PATH/quex-exe.py
      > chmod a+rx /usr/local/bin/quex

   On Windows, the file ``quex.bat`` should be copied into ``C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM``
   where most probably executable files can be found.

This is all for the installation of Quex. Your should now be able 
to type on the command line::

  > quex --version

and get a result similar to::

    Quex - Fast Universal Lexical Analyzer Generator
    Version 0.57.1
    (C) 2006-2011 Frank-Rene Schaefer
    ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY

Note, that with the operating system installers there might be problems
occuring with previous installations. Thus, when updating better better 
move any older installation to a place where the system can find them
(e.g. in the trash can). 

.. describe:: Compilation

    When compiling Quex-generated code the QUEX_PATH
    must be provided as an include path, i.e. you must add 
    an ``-I`` option ``-I$QUEX_PATH`` on the command line
    or ``-I$(QUEX_PATH)`` in a Makefile.

    In the sub directories of ``$QUEX_PATH/demo`` there are many
    examples of how to do that.

.. describe:: IConv, or ICU

    If you want to use character set conversion, you need to install one of the
    supported libraries--currently IBM's ICU <http://icu-project.org/userguide/intro.html>
    or GNU IConv <http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>[#f1]_.

That is all. Now, you should either copy the directories ``./demo/*`` to a
place where you want to work on it, or simply change directory to there.  These
directories contain sample applications 000, 001, $\ldots$. Change to the directory of the
sample applications and type ``make``. If everything is setup properly,
you will get your first quex-made lexical analyser executable in a matter
of seconds. 

.. note::

   It was reported that a certain development environment called 'VisualStudio'
   from a company called 'Microsoft' requires the path to python
   to be set explicitly. Development environments may have their own set
   of variables that need to be adapted.

The example applications depict easy ways to specify
traditional lexical analysers, they show some special features of quex such
as mode transitions, and more. Each demo-application deals with a particular
feature of quex: 

.. data:: demo/000

          shows how to setup a lexical analyzer very quickly.

.. data:: demo/001

          demonstrates basics on modes and mode transitions.

.. data:: demo/002

          contains a sample application for an indentation based language.

.. data:: demo/003

          implements a lexical analyzer handling UTF8 encoding. Quex creates an
          engine that relies on *converters* ICU and IConv. The converters
          are used to convert the incoming data stream to unicode. The internal
          engine still runs on plain unicode code points.

          In contrast, directory demo/011 an example is shown how quex creates
          analyzer engines that do not need converters. The engine itself 
          understands the codec and triggers on its code elements.

.. data:: demo/004

          contains a setup to generate a lexical analyser for the 'C' language.
          Users are encouraged to submit other exciting examples of their language.

.. data:: demo/005

          explains how to do lexical analysis with files that include other files.

.. data:: demo/006

          contains an example that treats *pseudo ambiguous post contexts* (or,
          'dangerous trailing contexts) which are difficult to deal with by
          means of traditional lexical analyser generators.

.. data:: demo/007

          examples showing pattern priorization between base and derived modes as well as
          applications of ``PRIORITY-MARK`` and ``DELETION``.

.. data:: demo/008

          shows how a quex generated lexer is linked to a bison generated parser. 

.. data:: demo/009

          shows how analyzers can be implemented for ``char`` and ``wchar_t`` string streams.

.. data:: demo/010

          shows how to access the analyzer's memory buffer directly. It also
          contains an example, ``stdinlexer.cpp``, that shows how to parse the
          standard input (i.e. the ``cin`` or ``stdin`` stream).

.. data:: demo/011

          provides an example of how to adapt the character encoding of the
          lexical analyzer engine without using converters. Example codecs are 
          iso8859-7 and utf8.

.. data:: demo/012

          gives an example of how to use multiple lexical analyzers in one single
          application. 

.. data:: demo/012b

          deals with multiple lexical analyzers sharing the same token type.

.. data:: benchmark

          contains a benchmark suite to measure the performance of the lexical
          analyzer. As an example a benchmark for a C-lexer is implemented. The
          suite can build lexical analyzers based on quex, but also as a
          comparison the same analyzers generated by flex and re2c.

The author of this document suggests that the user looks at these sample
applications first before continuing with the remainder of this text.  With the
background of easy-to-use examples to serve as starting point for their own
efforts, it should be natural to get a feeling for the ease of quex.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] If you are glad to work on a Linux system, the probability that your 
         distribution provides pre-configured installation packages for those 
         libraries is very high. Nevertheless, there are also wellness packages for other
         operating systems.
