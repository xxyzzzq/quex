Stability
==========

Quex has grown over the years, gained more and more features and became more
and more complex. In the frame of this development many refactorings and
redesigns happend in order to maintain a transparent clear code structure.  The
basis for a solid refactoring are automated unit tests and system tests. By
means of these tests it is verified that changes to the code or the design do
not influence the functioning of the system.

Additionally to the tests for the implemented modules, it is tried
to implement for every non-trivial bug and feature request a regression test that
ensures that the error does not occur in any future release. Since no release
is made without all tests being passed a certain level of quality is
guaranteed. Nevertheless, no bug is too small to be reported. It is by bug
reports that quex has gained its actual level of maturity. 

.. note::

    **Please, do not hesitate to report bugs!** 
    
    The few minutes spend to submit a bug may help to improve the quality for
    many other users or pinpoint to new interesting issues. In the humble
    history of quex there have been several cases where small issues let
    to important design changes. Much of the maturity of quex is due to 
    changes that were made due to bug reports.

Released versions of quex come with a file ``unit_test_results.txt`` that
contains descriptions of all performed tests. It allows the user to overview the
level of testing. Any observed lack of coverage may be reported as bug or
feature request.
