Mounting two state machines together in sequence is fairly
simple. If state machine B is to be mounted after state machine
A, then the following is to be done:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Clone both state machines, to make sure that we have unique
      state-ids inside the two machines, and operations won't 
      influence the originals A and B.
\item Mount an epsilon transition from all acceptance states of A
      to the initial state of B.
\item Disable acceptance of all acceptance states in A.
\item Collect all states of A and B into a single state machine.
\end{enumerate}

These steps imply that the acceptance state of the last state machine
remains. In {\Quex} an algorithm is implemented that does the sequentialization
for any number of state machines---not just two---in one beat.
In figure \ref{fig:mount-sequential} a state machine is created representing
a 'matcher' for floating point numbers out of the sequentialized patterns
\pattern{$[$0-9$]+$}, \pattern{.}, and pattern{$[$0-9$]+$}.
