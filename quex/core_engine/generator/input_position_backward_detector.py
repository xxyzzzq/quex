# PURPOSE: Where there is a pseudo ambiguous post-condition, there
#          cannot be made an immediate decision about the input position after
#          an acceptance state is reached. Instead, it is necessary to 
#          go backwards and detect the start of the post-condition 
#          a-posteriori. This function produces code of the backward
#          detector inside a function.
