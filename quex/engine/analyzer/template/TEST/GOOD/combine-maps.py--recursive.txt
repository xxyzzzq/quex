Involved states in First = 1L
Involved states in Second = 2L
=> when First triggers to 1L and Second to 2L, then both
   are recursive and no distinction needs to be made.

(Straight)---------------------------------------

|         |                            |    1, 2;
|                                      |    2;

BorderN     = 1
TargetCombN = 

(Vice Versa)-------------------------------------

|                                      |    2;
|         |                            |    1, 2;

BorderN     = 1
TargetCombN = 

A target combination (1L, 2L) and vice versa has not to appear,
because this would mean recursion and is thus an equivalence.
