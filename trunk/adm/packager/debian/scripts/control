             Quex is a lexical analyzer generator that produces
             a directly coded lexical analyzer engine. Special

             sophisticated buffer handling,
             analyzer modes that can be inherited,
             event handlers for modes,
             Unicode support as well as a large variety of 
             character encodings.
