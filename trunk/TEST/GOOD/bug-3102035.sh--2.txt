## In this test we try to avoid issues with some 'weird' cases that
## produced duplicate state labels. The the compiler warnings such as
## 
##   Case3.c:154: error: duplicate label ‘STATE_39’
##   Case3.c:151: error: previous definition of ‘STATE_39’ was here
##
## would appear. If they do not, then everything is fine.

case2.qx:10:error: The pre context contains in a 'nothing is necessary' path in the state machine.
case2.qx:10:error: This means, that without reading a character the analyzer drops into
case2.qx:10:error: an acceptance state. E.g., pattern 'x*/y/' means that zero or more 'x' are a pre-
case2.qx:10:error: condition for 'y'. If zero appearances of 'x' are enough, then obviously
case2.qx:10:error: there is no pre-condition for 'y'! Most likely the author intended 'x+/y/'.
