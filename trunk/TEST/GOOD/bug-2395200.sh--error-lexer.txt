<<QUEX_PATH>>/quex/code_base/buffer/filler/BufferFiller.i:161:	terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::runtime_error'
  what():  
The provided input stream behaves strangely. Number of read
characters is not proportional to the stream position increase.
The buffer filler type which you are using might be able to
deal with those cases. Try compile option:

-DQUEX_OPTION_STRANGE_ISTREAM_IMPLEMENTATION

However, those mechanisms imply a trade-off in terms of speed.
Please, consider using a 'binary' for your input stream, or use
a different implementation of the standard I/O library (e.g.
not Microsoft(tm)).

## Disable this message by compile option
##        '-DQUEX_OPTION_ASSERTS_WARNING_MESSAGE_DISABLED'
##
## Asserts activated! Lexical analyzer is 'paranoid'!
## => Even smallest misbehavior causes program exit.
##    This helps to find subtile errors.
##
## Note however: the paranoia is a heavy load on performance!

## Disable asserts by '-DQUEX_OPTION_ASSERTS_DISABLED'
