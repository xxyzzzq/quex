The name quex obviously has  a lexo-graphical relation to lex and flex--the most
well known tools for generating lexical analysers at the time of this writing. The
'Qu' at the beginning of the word stands for 'quick', so hopefully the new
features of quex and the ability to create directly coded engines will
generate much faster lexical analysers. Also, the process of programming shall
be much quicker by means of the handy shortcuts and elegant solutions that quex provides.

The last letter 'χ' is a the greek lowercase letter 'chi'.  It
is intended to remind the author of this text that he actually wanted to create
a better \TeX footnote:[As Donald Knuth explains it\cite{}, the last letter in
\TeX is an uppercase 'chi' so the name is to be pronounced like the German word
'ach' (it's actually more a sound Germans utter, rather than a word with a
       dedicated meaning). Analogously, the χ at the end of quex should
not be pronounced like the 'x' of the German word 'nix'.] system with optimized
source code appearance. When he realized that traditional lexical analysers did
not provide the functionality to express solutions easily he started working on
quex--and dove much deeper into the subject than he ever thought he would.
