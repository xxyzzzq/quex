(*) Lexical Analyser Patterns:
             <<EOF>> --> EOF STOP
                  x* --> X*
Regular expression parsing:
Pattern results in a 'nothing is acceptable' state machine.
This means, that no step forward in the input still sets the analyzer
into an acceptance state. Thus, as soon as no other input matches
the analyzer ends up in an infinite loop.
