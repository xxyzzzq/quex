Converter Helpers
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you read the documentation on converter helpers. Following notes 
recall some rationals about design decisions:

-- There are some converters which are UNIVERSAL, i.e. they may be used 
   accross lexical analyzers, accross token classes, and even beyond
   quex. 

   Accordingly, they are placed in subdirectory './universe'. They
   can be used and included without parameterization in any program.

   They are placed in namespace 'quex'.

-- Other converters are specific, that is, they depend on the QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER
   and may be even the codec (if not converter is used).

   Those are analyzer specific and are thus placed in namespace 
   'QUEX_NAMESPACE_MAIN' as defined in the generated configuration file.

-- Codec converters are generated FOR a particular analyzer, BUT they function
   independently. That is, a converter from 'ASCII Latin 1' to 'UTF8' does
   the job independent on the definition of QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER or 
   other analyzer specific parameters. 
   
   Thus: they are considered UNIVERSAL and generated into namespace 'quex'. 
   
-- To maintain consistency, lots of code is generated by the C-Preprocessor.
   The generator headers are located in './generator'. Those 'generators'
   are used to generate UNIVERSAL and SPECIFIC code. So, they do not 
   contain any namespace. The namespace of the generated functions must
   be determined by the including file.
