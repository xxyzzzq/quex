Codec Queries
=============

The usage of codecs is facilitated with the following query options:

.. cmdoption:: `--codec` [codec-name]

   Displays the characters which are supported by the given codec name.  If no
   codec name is omitted, the list of all supported codecs is printed on the
   screen.

.. cmdoption:: `--codec-for-language` [language-name]

   Displays all supported codecs which are designed for the specified (human)
   language.  If no language's name is omitted, the list of all supported codecs
   is printed on the screen.

For example, if it is intended to design an input language for Chinese, quex
can be called to show the directly supported codecs (other than Unicode)::

    > quex --codec-for-language

shows the list of supported languages::

    ...
    command line: English, Traditional Chinese, Hebrew, Western Europe, 
    command line: Greek, Baltic languages, Central and Eastern Europe, 
    command line: Bulgarian, Byelorussian, Macedonian, Russian, Serbian, 
    command line: Turkish, Portuguese, Icelandic, Canadian, Arabic, Danish, 
    command line: Norwegian, Thai, Japanese, Korean, Urdu, Vietnamese, 
    command line: Simplified Chinese, Unified Chinese, West Europe, Esperanto, 
    command line: Maltese, Nordic languages, Celtic languages, Ukrainian, 
    command line: Kazakh,

Now, asking for the codecs supporting the Celtic language::

    > quex --codec-for-language 'Celtic languages'

delivers ``iso8859_14`` as possible codec. Again a call to quex
allows to verify if all desired characters are supported. 

    > quex --codec iso8859_14

By means of those queries it can be decided quickly which character encoding is
the most appropriate for ones needs.
