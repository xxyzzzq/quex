Usage
=====

This section introduces the basics for using quex. A minimalist, but complete, example
shall display the process of generating a lexical analyser engine with quex. A short section
gives an overview over the major sections of a quex definition file. In two 
separate sections the definition of patterns and their related actions is explained. 
Pattern-action pairs are grouped in modes. The particularities of mode definitions
is explained in a dedicated section. At this point in time the user is familiar
with the syntax of the input language of quex. A final section discusses the 
command line arguments for the invokation of quex on the command, or in Makefiles 
and project files.
