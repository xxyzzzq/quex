Compile Options
===============

Quex offers a set of compile options that can be set by specifying them
via the ``-D`` flag of the C-compiler. No explicit setting is necessary to create a
working analyzer. The options, though, allow to configure and fine tune the
lexical analyzer engine. The compile options split into the following groups

.. cmacro:: QUEX_OPTION_ ...

   These macros can either be defined or not. If they are defined they trigger 
   a certain behavior. All macros of this group have a sibling of the shape::

       QUEX_OPTION_ ... _DISABLED

   If this option is set than any setting is outruled, even those that have 
   been set by quex.

.. cmacro:: QUEX_SETTING_ ...

   These macros contain a value that is expanded in the code of quex. 

.. cmacro:: QUEX_TYPE_ ...

   By means of those macros types are defined.
