Indentation Based Blocks
------------------------

With the rise of the Python programming language, the use of indentation as the
block delimiter has become popular. Classical programming languages such as C,
Java, and Pascal, rely on brackets, e.g. ``{`` and ``}`` for opening and
opening blocks. Indentation based languages rely on the indentation space
of a code fragment. For example, in the C-code statements list:

.. code-block:: cpp

   while( i < L ) 
   {
       if( check_this(i) ) 
       {
           do_something();
       }
   }
   print("done")

blocks are delimited ``{`` and ``}``. An equivalent statement list in an
indentation based language, such as Python looks like the following: 
        
.. code-block:: python

   while i < L:
       if check_this(i): 
           do_something()
   print("done")

The code in the second example, obviously looks much more dense and contains
lesser visual noise. For readability, code is best indented according to the
block it belongs to. In this sense the brackets are redundant--if one is able
to detect the indentation. Quex generated engines can.

For the parser to group statements into blocks, it requires that tokens
are sent that indicate the opening and closing of a block. When relying 
on explicit delimiters, such as brackets, then this does not require
any additional effort. For clarity, let 'indentation' be defined as follows:

.. note:: *Indentation* is considered the amount of white space between
          the beginning of a line and the first non-white space character
          in a line.

For indentation based languages the lexical analyzer has some work to do behind
the scenes. It must count indentation, detect whether blocks are opening, remain
the same, or are closing. When closing blocks, is possible that with one step
multiple tokens may be sent. In the example above, after the function call
``do_something()``, two scopes close the ``if`` and the ``while`` block.
Quex generated code takes care of this.

If indentation counting is enabled, Quex generated engines send the following
tokens:

 * ``INDENT`` if an indentation block opens.
 * ``DEDENT`` if an indentation block closes.
 * ``NODENT`` if the indentation remains the same.

An indentation counting framework is implemented for a mode as soon as a
``indentation`` option is specified--even an empty option will do::

  .. code-block:: cpp

     mode X : 
         <indentation: /* all default */> 
     {
        ...
     }

There are different philosophies around indentation based parsing with respect
to spaces, tab characters, and newline suppressors. Even the definition of the
newline pattern may be subject to discussion (e.g. 0xA or 0xD, 0xA, or both).
Inside the ``indentation`` option the character of those can be specified, e.g.

.. code-block:: cpp

          <indentation:
             [ \t]      => white space;
             (\r\n)|\n  => newline;
             \\[ \t]*   => suppressor;
          >

specifies that a normal space and tab characters count as white space. Thus, the
indentation will be counted as long as the incoming characters after newline
are either space or tab character. The column number increment can be specified by
the ``<counter ...>`` for a mode (:ref:`sec-counter`). Both, the Unix (``\\n``)
and the DOS Version of newline (``\\r\\n``) are accepted as ``newline``. A
newline suppressor is defined as a backslash. Since white space between the
backslash and newline is hardly identified, possible white space is packed into
the definition of the suppressor. The above setup is a *safe* setup to work on
many environments and it helps to avoid confusion. It is indeed the default
setup which is in place, if nothing is specified. The following section
explains in detail the setting of the above parameters.

Indentation Parameters
======================

As with ``counter`` definitions (see :ref:`sec-counter-def`), the syntax of
parameter settings in the ``indentation`` option follows the scheme:

.. code-block:: cpp

       pattern '=>' parameter-name [argument] ';'

The allowed parameter names are ``space``, ``grid``, ``bad``, ``newline``, and
``suppressor``. The first three parameter names allow only character sets as 
pattern. For ``newline`` and ``suppressor`` any regular expression can 
by given. The following list explains the different parameters.

   .. describe :: white space

      Defines the set of allowed character in the indentation. As soon as 
      a character appears that is not white space, the indentation is 
      equal to the column number. Note, that the indentation level is 
      determined by the number of open indentation blocks and not by 
      means of the column number directly.

   .. describe :: bad

      There is some philosophical discussion whether both spaces and grids or
      tab characters shal be allowed as indentation characters.  There are very
      rational arguments for 'spaces are bad' and so there are arguments for
      'tab characters are bad'.  If some characters are specifically to be
      considered bad, then they may be specified as such by the ``bad``
      keyword.  The philosophy of 'tabs are bad' can be expressed by

      .. code-block:: cpp
         
             [\t]  =>  bad; 

   .. describe :: newline

      Indentation count is triggered by 'newline'. By this specifier it
      can be determined what character or character sequence triggers the
      indentation count. For example,

      .. code-block:: cpp

           (\r\n)|\n  => newline;

      matches newlines under DOS (0x0D, 0x0A) and under Unix (0x0A).  All
      specifiers before only accept character sets as input. Clearly, the
      newline specifier accepts a full regular expression. 


      .. note::

      The newline pattern will be used to trigger the indentation counting.
      Actually, the newline pattern is automatically extended to the pattern::

               newline [[ ispace ]* newline]*

      and inserted into state machine. Here, ``ispace`` is any kind of
      indentation counter mentioned in ``space`` or ``grid``. By means of this
      construction empty lines are eaten silently. Thus, it is avoided that 
      empty lines cause a DEDENT or NODENT incidences. 

   .. describe :: suppressor

      The newline incidence can be suppressed by a subsequent suppressor. When it
      is suppressed the subsequent line is not going to be subject to
      indentation count. Famous suppressors are the backslash, as in Python, C,
      and Makefiles, or the underline '_' as in some Basic dialects. For example,
      the backslash in

      .. code-block :: python

         if    db.out_of_date() \
            or db.disconnected(): 
                ...

      prevents the python interpreter to consider indentation before the 'or'
      which is now grouped into the if-condition.
      
      Many times interpreters are sensitive to white space that follows these. 
      Quex allows to be less sensitive by defining the suppressor as a regular
      expression, e.g.

      .. code-block:: cpp

         \\[ \t]*   => suppressor;

      eats any amount of non-newline white space after the suppressor '\\'.

   .. describe :: comment
  
      Allows for the definition of a comment-until-newline region. When a
      comment is reached it will not be treated as indentation. If the
      detection of comments is left to patterns inside the mode, it would be
      triggering an indentation event. For example:

            while 1 + 1 == 2:
                do something
            # this is a comment
                do more

      When comment handling is left to the mode itself, then the comment in the
      ``#`` would trigger a ``DEDENT`` event, because a lower indentation has
      been detected. If it was defined inside the indentation handler as

         #((\\[^\n])|[^\n])+ => comment

      then no ``DEDENT`` is triggered. This is a more pythonic behavior.
                

          


      

When an indention option is specified, the generated lexical analyzer
starts sending tokens carrying indentation information. As mentioned earlier,
those are ``QUEX_TKN_INDENT`` if a new indentation block opens, ``QUEX_TKN_DEDENT``
if an indentation block closes, and ``QUEX_TKN_NODENT`` if the indentation
is the same as in the previous line. Note, that the newline character is eaten
by the indentation counter. If it is a statement delimiter, then it might
make sense to define in the ``token`` section something like::

   token { 
       ...
       NODENT = STATEMENT_END;
       ...
   }

which ensures that the token id of ``NODENT`` is the same as the id for
``STATEMENT_END`` and no special treatment is required. If more then one
token is to be sent on indentation incidences, or if some sophisticated 
customized handling is required the indentation incidences can be specified,
as shown in the next section.

Customized Indentation Incidence Handlers
=====================================

By default, a quex generated engine sends tokens on the incidence of indentation
and aborts on the incidence of a bad character or indentation error. If this
behavior is not enough, the correspondent actions may be customized by
means of incidence handlers, as they are:

  * ``on_indent`` on the incidence that an opening indentation occurs.

    For example in the code fragment

    .. code-block:: python

       while 1 + 1 == 2:
           print "Hello"
           print "World"

    The ``print`` commands are more indented than the ``while`` key word. This indicates
    that the prints are in a nested block. On the incidence of the first indented ``print``
    key word the ``on_indent`` handler is called. The user might want to send an ``INDENT``
    token to indicate the opening of a block. For example:

    .. code-block:: cpp

       on_indent { 
           self_send(QUEX_TKN_INDENT);
       }

  * ``on_dedent`` and ``on_n_dedent`` on the incidence that one ore mode 
    indentation blocks are closed.

    Note, that by means of a single line multiple indentation blocks may
    be closed. For example in

    .. code-block:: python

       while time() < 3600:
           if time() % 10: 
               print "Tick"
       print "End"

    The line containing ``print "End"`` closes the ``if`` block and the
    ``while`` block. It is appropriate that the lexical analyzer sends two
    ``DEDENT`` tokens. There are basically two ways to do this. Either by
    sending a ``DEDENT`` token each time an indentation block closes, or
    by counting the indentation blocks which close and the start the sending
    of the ``DEDENT`` tokens. Accordingly there are two de-dentation handlers.

    .. describe:: on_dedent

       Argument: ``First``
    
       The ``on_dedent`` handler is called repeatedly for each closing
       indentation. Each time the handler is called one ``DEDENT`` token should
       be sent. If there are things to be done only once for whole a de-dentation
       sequence, then the flag ``First`` can be used. It is ``true`` for the
       first de-dedentation incidence of a sequence and ``false`` for any other. A
       typical usage would be 

         .. code-block:: cpp

            on_dedent { 
                ...
                if( First ) self_send(QUEX_TKN_NEWLINE);
                self_send(QUEX_TKN_DEDENT);
                ...
            }

    .. describe:: on_n_dedent

       Argument: ``ClosedN``

         The ``on_n_dedent`` is called after the number of closing indentations
         has been counted and it receives the argument ``ClosedN``. This
         argument indicates the number of closed indentations.  A typical
         handler will then call ``self_send_n(...)`` somewhere down the lines
         as shown below.

         .. code-block:: cpp

            on_n_dedent { 
                ...
                /* provided that token repetition support is enabled! */
                self_send_n(ClosedN, QUEX_TKN_DEDENT);
                ...
            }

         It is advisable to activate token repetition support :ref:``, since otherwise
         the token queue might be flooded with ``DEDENT`` tokens.


  * ``on_nodent`` on the incidence that the current line has the same indentation
                  as the previous.

  * ``on_indentation_error`` on the incidence that a lesser indentation occured 
                             which does not fit the indentation borders of 
                             previous indentation blocks.

     .. describe:: Indentation

        The indentation that has occured.

     .. describe:: IndentationStackSize

        The number of currently open indentation blocks.

     .. describe:: IndentationStack(i)

        Delivers the indentation number 'i' from the current 
        indentation blocks.

     .. describe:: IndentationUpper

        Delivers the smallest indentation level that is greater than the current.

     .. describe:: IndentationLower

        Delivers the greatest indentation level that is smaller than the current.

     .. describe:: ClosedN

        Number of closed indentation levels.


  * ``on_indentation_bad`` on the incidence that a *bad* indentation character 
                           occured. The argument to this handler is

     .. describe:: BadCharacter

        A constant that contains the bad indentation character. It is of
        type ``QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER``.

     Quex does not forbid the definition of a pattern that contains the 
     bad character. The contrary, it is essential to define such a pattern
     in case that only a warning is intended and not a break up of the 
     lexical analysis. A skipper will also do. For example, 

     .. code-block:: cpp

         mode X : <indentation: [\t] => bad;> 
                  <skip: [\t]> 
         {
             ...
             on_indentation_bad { 
                 std::cout << "Warning: Bad indentation character!\n"; 
             }
             ...
         }

     is a reasonable setup in a lexical analyzer that forbids tab characters in 
     indentation. Alternatively, a 'bad character token' might be defined 
     and sent.

The following code fragment shows an example application that implements
the default behavior.

   .. code-block:: cpp

      on_indent {
          self_send(QUEX_TKN_INDENT);
      }
      on_dedent {
          self_send(QUEX_TKN_DEDENT);
      }
      on_nodent {
          self_send(QUEX_TKN_NODENT);
      }
      on_indentation_error {
          QUEX_ERROR_EXIT("Lexical analyzer mode 'MyMode': indentation error detected!\n");
      }
      on_indentation_bad {
          QUEX_ERROR_EXIT("Lexical analyzer mode 'MyMode': bad indentation character detected!\n");
      }

.. note::

   The current indentation level can be accessed via the macro
   ``self_indentation()``. For this, it holds the same as for line and column
   counting: The value is the current indentation level and not the level of
   indentation of the current token. For token policy ``token-queue`` this
   value might be stored inside the token itself.

Remarks on Hand-Written Indentation Management
==============================================

It is not trivial to express indentation in terms of pattern action
pairs based solely on regular expressions. It is not enough to define a pattern
such as::

          P_INDENTATION_CATCHER    "\n"[ ]*

That is a newline followed by white space. Imagine, one introduces a comment
sign such as the traditional # for comment until newline. The comment eating
pattern would be at first glance::

          P_COMMENT_EATER    "#"[^\n]*\n

That is a # followed by anything but newline and then one newline. The action
related to this pattern would have to put back the last newline. Otherwise the
indentation catcher which starts with a newline can never trigger. In this
particular case, this problem can be solved by deleting the last newline from
the comment eater pattern, knowing that after as many not-newline as possible
there must be a newline, i.e.

          P_COMMENT_EATER    "#"[^\n]*

The last newline is then eaten by the indentation catcher. However, the main
problem remains: 

.. note:: 

   A design without indentation incidences, forces the pattern actions to know
   about each other.  Otherwise, they might not function properly together! In
   an environment of many different modes which are additionally related by
   inheritance, it is potentially difficult to guarantee that all pattern
   actions avoid interferences with some overal concepts. 

Similarly, catching indentation with pre-condition newline plus white space,
i.e. ``^[ \t]*`` is fragile, in the sense that another pattern that
contains newline plus white space might hinder this pattern from triggering.
In a lexical analyzer with dozens or hundreds of patterns this becomes
quickly unmanageable. Errors that arise from patterns defined somewhere
else are very hard to find and require a lot of insight into the actual
process of lexical analysis. Using the quex's ability to detect indentation 
blocks ends up in a much clearer and safer design. 


Caveat
------

If a pattern contains more than one newline then only the indentation
incidence concerning the last newline is triggered! Imagine a pattern such as
in the following example::

     mode INDENTICUS { 
        " "*"hello"[\n]+" "*"world"[\n]+" "*"how are you?" => TKN_STRANGE;
     }

then the following pattern would match::

     hello
   world
        how are you?

If this matches, then the lines of ``hello`` and ``world`` do not trigger an
indentation incidence. So, when dealing with indentation based scoping such strange
things are best avoided.  If the line after the concatinated line does
not end with a backslash the incidence handler is automatically active and
indentation handling is in place. Lets turn this into a warning.

.. warning::

   Avoid having multiple non-white space sub patterns (such as keywords or
   identifiers) concatinated by newline-containing sub-patterns in 
   *one single pattern*. Otherwise only the last transition from white space 
   to non-white space inside the pattern triggers an indentation incidence.

The author of this text hopes that this caveat is only of theoretical interest.
It is hard to imagine a case where such a construct would actually make sense.
In any case, before implementing an indentation based analyzer it is advisable
to have a look at the demo/002 directory for a functioning example.
