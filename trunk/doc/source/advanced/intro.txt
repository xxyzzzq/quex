Advanced Usage
==============

The previous chapter was concerned with the implementation of 
lexical analyzer. This chapter focussed on advanced topics
concerned with memory management and computation time. It
not only sheds light on some internal mechanisms of the engine that
quex generates, but also gives a toolset at hand that allows for
the optimization of memory consumption and analysis speed.
