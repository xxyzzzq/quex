User defined Token Classes
==========================

For some tokens the token identifier is sufficient information for the parse.
This is true for tokens of the kind ``OPERATOR_PLUS`` which tells that a plus
sign was detected. Other token types might require some information about the
actually found lexeme. A token containing an identifier might have to carry the
lexeme that actually represents the identifier. A number token might carry the
actual number that was found.  Queχ provides a default token class that allows
the storage of a string object, an integer value. It is, however, conceivable
that there is more complex information to be stored in the token, or that the
information can be stored more efficiently. For this case, quex allows the
definition of a customized token class.  The first subsection introduces a
convienent feature of quex that allows to specify a token class without
worries.  The second subsection explains the detailed requirements for a
customized, user written token class. 

Before continuing the reader should be aware, though, that there are two basic
ways to treat token information:

#. Interpreting the lexeme at the time of lexical analysis. 

   This requires in a sophisticated token class which can carry all 
   related information.

#. Interpreting the lexeme at parsing time, when a syntax tree is build.

   This requires only a very basic token class that carries only the 
   lexeme itself. 

The interpretation of the lexeme needs to be done anyway.  The first
approach puts the weight on the sholders of the lexical analyzer, the second
approach places the responsibility on the parser. For fine tuning 
both approaches should be studies with respect to their memory print and cache
locality. It might not be the first approach which is always preferable.

The remaining framework of quex does not any adaptions to a customized token
class. If the token class is designed according certain rules, then it fits
smoothly in any generated engine.

.. _sec-customized-token-class:

Customized Token Classes
------------------------

Quex has the ability to generate a customized token class that satisfies 
all formal requirements automatically: In the code section ``token_type`` 
a dedicated token type can be specified with a minimum amount of 
information. The underlying model of a general token class is displayed
in figure `Token Class Model <fig-token-class-model>`. The memory of
token object consists of three regions:

#. A region that contains *mandatory* information that each token requires, 
   such as a token id, and (optionally) line and column numbers[#f1]_.

   Quex provides a means to specify the concrete type of those mandatory 
   members.

#. A region that contains *distinct* members, i.e. members that appear
   in each token object, but which are not mandatory. Each place in the
   memory is associated with a specific type.

   For distinct members, both, type and member name can be specified.

#. A region of *union* members which is a chunk of memory which can 
   be viewed differently, depending on the token id. This way, 
   the *same* piece of memory can be associated with multiple
   types.

.. note::

   All type names used in the ``token_type`` section must be available!  This
   means, that definitions or the header files which define them must be either
   built-in, or mentioned in the ``header`` code section.  If, for example,
   ``std::string`` and ``std::cout`` are to be used, the code should look like

   .. code-block:: cpp

      header {
      #include <string>
      #include <iostream>
      }
      ...
      token_type {
          ...
           distinct {
               my_name   std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER>;
           }
           constructor {
               std::cout << "Hello Constructor\n";
           }
           ...
      }

The following is a list of all possible fields in a ``token_type`` section. All
fields are of the form ``keyword``, followed by ``{``, followed by content,
followed by ``}``.

.. data:: standard

   .. code-block:: cpp

       standard {
           id            : unsigned;
           line_number   : unsigned;
           column_number : unsigned;
       }

   The standard members are implemented in the actual token class with a
   preceeding underscore.  That means, ``id`` becomes ``_id``, ``line_number``
   becomes ``_line_number`` and ``column_number`` becomes ``_column_number``.
   Depending on the setting of the macros::

        QUEX_OPTION_COLUMN_NUMBER_COUNTING
        QUEX_OPTION_LINE_NUMBER_COUNTING

   the members ``_line_number`` and ``_column_number`` are are enabled or 
   disabled.

.. data:: distinct

   .. code-block:: cpp

       distinct {
           name        :  std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER>;
           number_list :  std::vector<int>;
       }

.. data:: union

   .. code-block:: cpp

       union {
           { 
              mini_x : int8_t;
              mini_y : int8_t;
           }
           { 
              big_x  : int16_t;
              big_y  : int16_t;
           }
           position  : uint16_t;
       }

The variable definitions inside these regions create automatically a framework
that is able to deal with the token senders :ref:`sec:usage-sending-tokens`.
These token senders work like overloaded functions in C++. This means that the
particularly used setters are resolved via the type of the passed arguments. 
For the three sections above the following setters are defined in the token 
class

  .. code-block:: cpp

    void set(const QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN_ID ID);
    void set_mini_x(const int8_t Value);
    void set_mini_y(const int8_t Value);
    void set_big_x(const int16_t Value);
    void set_big_y(const int16_t Value);
    void set_position(const int16_t Value);

Those are then implicitly used in the token senders. Note, that it is
particularly useful to have at least one member that can carry a
``QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER`` pointer so that it can catch the lexeme as a plain
argument. As mentioned, the setter must be identified via the type.
The above setters would allow token senders inside a mode to be defined as

  .. code-block:: cpp

    mode TEST { 
        fred|otto|karl => QUEX_TKN_NAME(Lexeme);
        mini_1         => QUEX_TKN_N1b(mini_x=1, position=1); 
        big_1          => QUEX_TKN_N1c(big_x=1,  position=2);

    }

The brief token senders may be rely on with *named* arguments, except for 
the two convenience pattern ``TKN_X(Lexeme)`` and ``TKN_X(Begin, End)``
--as mentioned in :ref:`usage-sending-tokens`. 

If more flexibility is required explicit C-code fragments 
:ref:`sec:c-code-fragments` may be implemented relying on the
current token pointer, i.e. the member function

    .. code-block:: cpp

        QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN*  token_p()

and then explicitly call the named setters such as 
 
     .. code-block:: cpp

        ...
        self.token_p()->set_name(Lexeme);
        self.token_p()->set_mini_1(LexemeL); 
        ...
         
Standard operations of the token class can be specified via three code
sections. The variable ``self`` is a reference to the token object itself.

.. note::

   The assigment operator '=' is provided along the token class. However,
   there is a potential a major performance loss due to its passing of a 
   return value. When copying tokens, better rely on the ``__copy`` 
   member function.


.. data:: constructor

   This code section determines the behavior at construction time. The token 
   class provides a default constructor and a copy constructor. In case of the
   copy constructor, the code segment is executed *after* the copy operation (see below).
   Example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       constructor { 
           self.pointer_to_something = 0x0;   /* default */
           std::cout << "Constructor\n"; 
       }

.. data:: destructor

   The destructor code segment is executed at the time of the destruction of the
   token object. Here, all resources owned by the token need to be released. Example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       destructor { 
           if( self.pointer_to_something != 0x0 ) delete pointer_to_something;
           std::cout << "Destructor\n"; 
       }

.. data:: copy

   This code segment allows for the definition of customized copy operations. It is
   executed when the member function ``__copy`` is called or when the assigment 
   operator is used. 

   Implicit Argument: ``Other`` which is a reference to the token to be copied.

   .. code-block:: cpp

       copy { 
           std::cout << "Copy\n"; 
           /* Copy core elements: id, line, and column number */
           self._id = Other._id;
       #      ifdef     QUEX_OPTION_TOKEN_STAMPING_WITH_LINE_AND_COLUMN
       #      ifdef QUEX_OPTION_LINE_NUMBER_COUNTING
                  self._line_n = Other._line_n;
       #      endif
       #      ifdef  QUEX_OPTION_COLUMN_NUMBER_COUNTING
                  self._column_n = Other._column_n;
       #      endif
       #      endif

           /* copy all members */
           self.name        = Other.name;
           self.number_list = Other.number_list;
           /* plain content copy of the union content */
           self.content     = Other.content;
       }

   Alternative to copying each member one-by-one, it may be advantegous to rely
   on the optimized standard ``memcpy`` of the operating system.  The default
   copy operation does exactly that, but is not aware of related data
   structures. If there are non-trivial related data structures, they need to
   be dealt with 'by hand'. This is shown in the following example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       copy { 
           /* Explicit Deletion of non-trivial members */
           self.name.~std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER>();
           self.number_list.~std::vector<int>();

           /* Copy the plain memory chunk of the token object. */
           __STD_QUEX_memcpy((void*)&self, (void*)&Other), sizeof(QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN));
           
           /* Call placement new for non-trivial types: */
           new(&self.name)        std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER>(Other.name);
           new(&self.number_list) std::vector<int>(Other.number_list);
       }


.. describe:: take_text

   Optional, only a must if string accumulator is activated.

   Whenever the accumulator flushes accumulated text it accesses the current
   token and passes its content to the function ``take_text``. Inside the
   section the following variables can be accessed:
   
   .. describe:: self

      which is a reference to the token under concern.

   .. describe:: analyzer

      which gives access to the lexical analyzer so that decisions can be 
      made according to the current mode, line numbers etc.

   .. describe:: Begin, End

      wich are both pointers of ``QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER``. ``Begin`` points
      to the first character in the text to be received by the token. ``End``
      points to the first character *after* the string to be received.

   .. describe:: LexemeNull

      This is a pointer to the empty lexeme. The ``take_that`` section 
      might consider not to allocate memory if the LexemeNull is specified,
      i.e. ``Begin == LexemeNull``. This happens, for example, in the C default
      token implementation.

   The ``take_text`` section receives the raw memory chunk and is free to do
   what it wants with it. However, it must return a boolean value[#f2]_.  
   
   .. describe:: ``true`` 
   
      If ``true`` is returned the token took over the ownership over the memory
      chunk and claims responsibility to delete it. This is the case if the
      token maintains a reference to the text and does not want it to be
      deleted.

      .. warning:: 
      
          It is highly dangerous to apply this strategy if ``take_text``
          is called from inside the lexical analyzer. To claim ownership
          would mean that the token owns a piece of memory from the
          analyzer's buffer. This is impossible!

          There is a way to check whether the memory chunk is from the 
          analyzer's buffer. A check like the following is sufficient

          .. code-block:: cpp

             if(    Begin >= analyzer.buffer._memory._front 
                 && End   <= analyzer.buffer._memory._back ) {
                 /* Never claim ownership on analyzer's buffer ... */
                 /* Need one more space to store the terminating zero */
                 if( self.text != 0x0 ) {
                     QUEX_NAME(MemoryManager_Text_free(self.text);
                 }
                 self.text = QUEX_NAME(MemoryManager_Text_allocate)(sizeof(QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER)*(End - Begin + 1));
             } else {
                 /* Maybe, claim ownership. */
             }

   .. describe:: ``false`` 
   
      If ``false`` is returned the caller shall remain responsible. This can be
      used if the token does not need the text, or has copied it in a 'private'
      copy. 
      
      
   If the token takes over the responsibility for the memory chunk it must be
   freed in a way that correponds the memory management of the string
   accumulator. The safe way to accomplish this is by adding something like 

   .. code-block:: cpp

      constructor {
           self.text = 0x0;
      }

      destructor {
           if( self.text ) {
                QUEX_NAME(MemoryManager_Text_free)((void*)self.text);
           }
      }

      take_text {
          self.text = Begin;
          return true;
      }

The ``take_text`` section is vital for all analyzers that rely on lexeme content.
If it is not rock-solid, then the analyzer is on jeopardy. The default
implementations in ``$QUEX_PATH/code_base/token`` contain disabled debug sections
that may be copy-pasted into customized classes. For example for C, the default
implementation in ``CDefault.qx`` contains the sections

  .. code-block:: cpp

        #  if 0
           {
               /* Hint for debug: To check take_text change "#if 0" to "#if 1" */
               const QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER* it = 0x0;
               printf("previous:  '");
               if( self.text != 0x0 ) for(it = self.text; *it ; ++it) printf("%04X.", (int)*it);
               printf("'\n");
               printf("take_text: '");
               for(it = Begin; it != End; ++it) printf("%04X.", (int)*it);
               printf("'\n");
           }
        #  endif

           ... code of take_text ...

        #  if 0
           {
               /* Hint for debug: To check take_text change "#if 0" to "#if 1" */
               const QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER* it = 0x0;
               printf("after:     '");
               if( self.text != 0x0 ) for(it = self.text; *it ; ++it) printf("%04X.", (int)*it);
               printf("'\n");
           }
        #  endif

As mentioned in the comment, these section can be activated by switching the 
``0`` to ``1`` in the pre-processor conditionals.

Additional content may be added to the class' body using the following
code section:

.. describe:: body

   This allows to add constructors, member functions, friend declarations,
   internal type definitions etc. being added the token class. The content of
   this section is pasted as-is into the class body. Example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      body {
          typedef std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER> __string;

          void    register();
          void    de_register();
      private:
          friend  class MyParser;
      }

.. note:: The token class generator does not support an automatic generation
          of all possible constructors. If this was to be done in a sound and
          safe manner the formal language to describe this would add significant
          complexity. Instead, defining the constructors in the ``body`` section
          is very ease and intuitive.

When token repetition (see :ref:`sec-token-repetition`) is to be used, then 
the two following code fragments need to be defined 

   .. describe:: repetition_get

        The only implicit argument is ``self``. The return value shall be
        the stored repetition number.

   .. describe:: repetition_set

        Implicit arguments are ``self`` for the current token and ``N`` for
        the repetition number to be stored.

The code inside these fragments specifies where and how inside the token
the repetition number is to be stored and restored. In most cases the setting
of an integer member will do, e.g.

   .. code-block:: cpp

       repetition_set {
           self.number = N;
       }

       repetition_get {
           return self.number;
       }

In order to paste code fragments before and after the definition of the token class,
the following two sections may be used.

.. describe:: header

    In this section header files may be mentioned or ``typedef``s may be made
    which are required for the token class definition. For example, the definition of 
    token class members of type ``std::complex`` and ``std::string`` requires the following
    header section.

    .. code-block:: cpp

       header {
          #include <string>
          #include <complex>
       }

.. describe:: footer

    This section contains code to be pasted after the token class definition. This
    is useful for the definition of closely related functions which require the 
    complete type definition. The code fragment below shows the example of an
    output operator for the token type.

    .. code-block:: cpp

       footer {
            inline std::ostream&
            operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN_XXX& Tok)
            { ostr << std::string(Tok); return ostr; }
       }


The token class is written into a file that can be specified via

.. data:: file_name = name ';'


If no file name is specified the name is generated as engine name +
``"-token-class"``. The name of the token class and its namespace can be
specified via 

.. data:: name = [namespace ... ::] token class name ';'

   Where the term after the ``=`` sign can be either 
   
   * Solely, the name of the token class. In this case the class 
     is placed in namespace ``quex``. 
     
   * A list of identifiers separated by ``::``. Then all but the 
     last identifier is considered a name space name. The last identifier
     is considered to be the token class name. For example, 

     .. code-block:: cpp

       name = europa::deutschland::baden_wuertemberg::ispringen::MeinToken;

     causes the token class ``MeinToken`` to be created in the namespace ``ispringen``
     which is a subspace of ``baden_wuertemberg``, which is a subspace of ``deutschland``,
     which is a subspace of ``europa``.

In C++, when classes can be inherited they better provide a virtual destructor.
If this is required the flag

.. data:: inheritable ';'

can be specified. The following shows a sample definition of a ``token_type`` section.

.. code-block:: cpp

    token_type {
       name = europa::deutschland::baden_wuertemberg::ispringen::MeinToken;

       standard {
            id            :    unsigned;
            line_number   :    unsigned;
            column_number :    unsigned;
       }
       distinct {
           name        :  std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER>;
           number_list :  std::vector<int>;
       }
       union {
           { 
              mini_x       : int8_t;
              mini_y       : int8_t;
           }
           { 
              big_x        : int16_t;
              big_y        : int16_t;
           }
           who_is_that     : uint16_t;
       }
       inheritable;
       constructor { std::cout << "Constructor\n"; }
       destructor  { std::cout << "Destructor\n"; }
       body        { int __nonsense__; }
       copy        { 
           std::cout << "Copy\n"; 
           /* Copy core elements: id, line, and column number */
           _id         = Other._id;
    #      ifdef QUEX_OPTION_TOKEN_STAMPING_WITH_LINE_AND_COLUMN
    #      ifdef QUEX_OPTION_LINE_NUMBER_COUNTING
                  _line_n = Other._line_n;
    #      endif
    #      ifdef  QUEX_OPTION_COLUMN_NUMBER_COUNTING
                  _column_n = Other._column_n;
    #      endif
    #      endif
           /* copy all members */
           name        = Other.name;
           number_list = Other.number_list;
           /* plain content copy of the union content */
           content     = Other.content;
       }
    }

which results in a generated token class in C++:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class MeinToken {
    public:
        MeinToken();
        MeinToken(const MeinToken& That);
        void __copy(const MeinToken& That);
        /* operator=(..): USE WITH CAUTION--POSSIBLE MAJOR PERFORMANCE DECREASE! 
         *                BETTER USE __copy(That)                                */
        MeinToken operator=(const MeinToken& That) 
        { __copy(That); return *this; }
        virtual ~MeinToken();

        std::vector<int>                       number_list;
        std::basic_string<QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER> name;

        union {
            struct {

.. _sec-customized-token-class-formal:

Formal Requirements on Token Classes.
-------------------------------------

The previous section introduced a convienent feature to specify customized
token classes.  If this is for some reason not sufficient, a manually written
token class can be provided. 

.. note:: It is always a good idea to take a token class generated by quex
          as a basis for a manually written class. This is a safe path to
          avoid spurious errors.

The user's artwork is communicated to quex via the command line argument
``--token-class-file`` which names the file where the token class definition is
done. Additionally, the name and namespace of the token class must be specified
using the option ``--token-class``. For example::

  > quex ... --token-class MySpace::MySubSpace::MyToken

specifies that the name of the token class is ``MyToken`` which is located in
the namespace ``MySubSpace`` which is located in the global namespace
``MySpace``. This sets automatically the following macros in the configuration
file:

  .. describe:: QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN

     The name of the token class defined in this file together with its
     namespace.
  
     .. code-block:: cpp

        #define QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN   my_space::lexer::MyToken

  .. describe:: QUEX_TYPE0_TOKEN

     The token class without the namespace prefix, e.g.

     .. code-block:: cpp

        #define QUEX_TYPE0_TOKEN   MyToken
   

A hand written token class must comply to the following constraints:

    * The following macro needs to be defined outside the class:
       
      .. describe:: QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN_ID

         Defines the C-type to be used to store token-ids. It should at least
         be large enough to carry the largest token id number.

       
      It is essential to use macro functionality rather than a typedef, since
      later general definition files need to verify its definition. A good way
      to do the definition is shown below:
 
      .. code-block:: cpp

         #ifndef    QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN_ID 
         #   define QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN_ID              uint32_t
         #endif

      Note, that the header file might be tolerant with respect to external definitions
      of the token id type. However, since it defines the token class, it must assume
      that it has not been defined yet.

    * A member function that maps token-ids to token-names inside the token's namespace
    
      .. cfunction:: const char* QUEX_NAME_TOKEN(map_id_to_name)(QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN_ID Id)
   
      that maps any token-id to a human readable string. Note, that queχ does
      generate this function automatically, as long as it is not told not to do
      so by specifying command line option ``--user-token-id-file``. The macro
      ``QUEX_NAME_TOKEN`` adapts the mapping function to the appropriate
      naming. Relying on the above function signature allows to define the
      appropriate function.

    * Member functions that set token content, e.g. 
    
      .. cfunction:: void set(token::id_type TokenID, const char*)
      .. cfunction:: void set(token::id_type TokenID, int, int)
      .. cfunction:: void set(token::id_type TokenID, double)
      .. cfunction:: void set(token::id_type TokenID, double, my_type&)
   
     As soon as the user defines those functions, the interface for sending 
     those tokens from the lexer is also in place. The magic of templates lets 
     the generated lexer class provide an interface for sending of tokens that 
     is equivalent to the following function definitions: 
         
     .. cfunction:: void send(token::id_type TokenID, const char*)
     .. cfunction:: void send(token::id_type TokenID, int, int)
     .. cfunction:: void send(token::id_type TokenID, double)
     .. cfunction:: void send(token::id_type TokenID, int, my_type&)
   
     Thus, inside the pattern action pairs one can send tokens, for example 
     using the self reference the following way:

     .. code-block:: cpp 

          // map lexeme to my_type-object 
          my_type tmp(split(Lexeme, ":"), LexemeL); 
          self_send2(TKN_SOMETHING, LexemeL, tmp); 
          return; 

    * It must provide a member ``_id`` token's identifier 
      
      .. cfunction:: QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN_ID   _id

    * The following function must be defined. Even an empty definition will do.
    
      .. cfunction:: void QUEX_NAME_TOKEN(copy)(Token* me, const Token* Other) 

      .. cfunction:: void QUEX_NAME_TOKEN(construct)(Token* __this)

      .. cfunction:: void QUEX_NAME_TOKEN(destruct)(Token* __this)

    inline void
    QUEX_NAME_TOKEN(destruct)($$TOKEN_CLASS$$* __this)

      
      in the token's namespace which copies the content of token ``Other`` to the
      content of token ``me``.

    * If a text accumulator is to be used, i.e. ``QUEX_OPTION_STRING_ACCUMULATOR`` is 
      defined, then there must be a function 
    
      .. cfunction:: bool QUEX_NAME_TOKEN(take_text)(QUEX_TYPE_TOKEN*     me, 
                                                     QUEX_TYPE_ANALYZER*  analyzer, 
                                                     const QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER* Begin, 
                                                     const QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER* End)
      

      The meaning and requirements of this functions are the same as for the ``take_text``
      section above.

    * There must be member and member ``_line_n`` and ``_column_n`` for line and column 
      numbers which are dependent on compilation macros. The user must
      provide the functionality of the example code segment below.

      .. code-block:: cpp

         #   ifdef     QUEX_OPTION_TOKEN_STAMPING_WITH_LINE_AND_COLUMN
         #       ifdef QUEX_OPTION_LINE_NUMBER_COUNTING
                public:
                    size_t  _line_n;
                    size_t  line_number() const                 { return _line_n; }
                    void    set_line_number(const size_t Value) { _line_n = Value; }
         #       endif
         #       ifdef  QUEX_OPTION_COLUMN_NUMBER_COUNTING
                public:
                    size_t  _column_n;
                    size_t  column_number() const                 { return _column_n; }
                    void    set_column_number(const size_t Value) { _column_n = Value; }
         #       endif
         #   endif

      The conditional compilation must also be implemented for the ``__copy``
      operation which copies those values.

    

As long as these conventions are respected the user created token class will
interoperate with the framework smoothly. The inner structure of the token
class can be freely implemented according to the programmer's optimization
concepts.
