Event Handling
==============

User activity triggered by the lexical analyser is not restricted to 'on
pattern match' as it is implemented by pattern-action pairs.  Instead, quex
allows the definition of event handlers for several events. Those event
handlers can contain user written code which is executed as soon as the
particular event arrives. Examples for events are 'on_match' which is triggered
whenever a pattern matches, 'on_indentation' whenever there is a transition
from whitespace to non-whitespace after newline, and so on. Event handlers are
tied to modes, thus they are defined inside modes. An event handler of a mode A
is only armed as long as the lexical analyser is in that particular mode.

The following example shows how entry and exit of a mode may be used to 
send tokens that have been accumulated during analysis:

.. code-block:: cpp

    mode FORMAT_STRING { 
        ...
        on_entry { self.accumulator.clear(); }
        on_exit  { 
            self.accumulator.flush(QUEX_TKN_STRING); 
            self_send(QUEX_TKN_QUOTE);
        }
        ...
    }

The 'on_indentation' event handler may be used to create Python-like indentation
based languages--as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    mode PROGRAM {
        on_indentation {

            if( Indentation > self.indentation_stack.back() ) {
                ...
            }
            while( self.indentation_stack.back() > Indentation ) {
                self_send(QUEX_TKN_BLOCK_CLOSE);     
                self.indentation_stack.pop_back();
            }
            ...
        }

        {P_BACKSLASHED_NEWLINE} {
            self.disable_next_indentation_event();
        }
        ...
    }

The usage details about those example is explained in the sections to come.
