Quex's Syntax
**************

This chapter presents details about the specification language that Quex uses
as input.  The first section introduces the 'top-level' syntax, i.e. the syntax
that is used to configure different main entities. Two particular entities,
namely *modes* and *tokens*, are presented in great detail in later chapters.
So, this chapter is restricted to display basic schemes for the two. A second
section briefly summarizes how numbers can be specified. A larger third section
presents the syntax of regular expressions including the use of the Unicode
database.
