Many cultures of the world in the history of mankind developped many types of
scripts. A script in a more technical sense decribes the relationship between a
*phonetic expression* or a *meaning* and its *graphical representation*[#f1]_. The
element of a writing is a character and its numerical representation is called
a *code-point* or a *character code*. The formal relationship between characters
and code-points is called an *encoding*. A lexical analyzer generator, that tries
to be universal must therefore reflect the multitude of encodings. Much development
in computer science at the end of the 2000's century has been made in a region 
of the world where the English was predominant. For this reason, the so called 
ASCII Standard encoding became widespread, even though, it does only support
English characters. 

With the dramatic change of global interactions and communcations, the need 
for character encodings from other languages becomes indispensable. On of the
major goals is to support the lexical analysis of any type of encoding. The
following sections provide an overview about the lexical analysis process
of a generated engine, explain the usage of libraries for the conversion
of character encodings to unicode, and finally explain how user generated
converters can be plugged into the process.

.. [#f1] Humans reflect over information in terms of phonetical expressions or 
         meanings. Therefore scripts provide the basis for the *transport of information*
         over time and space. Being able to transport information from person
         to person, or preserve information for later generations is the key
         for any development of civilization.

         The usage of automated tools for the writing and interpretion of information
         acts as an accelerator for the motor of civilization. In the vision
         of the author quex makes its contribution to civilization by providing means
         for automatic interpretation of information.
