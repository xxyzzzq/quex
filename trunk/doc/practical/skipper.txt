In order to skip portions of the input without considering its content, quex provides
the ability to define so called 'skippers'. Skippers can be used, for example, to
skip whitespaces and comments. Of course, most of the skippers can also be 
defined as patterns that have no action related to it. However, there are great 
advantages to using skippers rather than their implementation as a 'skipping pattern'.

- Skippers perform much faster than usual regular expressions. Their implementation
  is adapted to the buffer handling and reduces comparisons to a minimum.

- Skippers reduce the minimum required buffer size. For example, comments in C programs
  can become very lengthy. If they were to be parsed by the general engine, then they
  would require that the buffer size is as big as the largest thinkable comment. Skippers
  do not suffer this constraint. A buffer of the size of five characters may suffice to 
  parse a range of arbitrary size.

- The _nested_ skipper is a feature that can not be achieved by regular expressions since it
  implies recursion. A nested skipper, can for example be used to parse a region of 
  closing and opening '{' brackets down the the '}' which matches the current level.

This shows, that skippers are a very powerful tool to reduce computation time
and memory constraints of the created lexical analyser. Additionally, they add
clarity to the code that describes the analyser. When an end-of-file is reached
before the range skipper ends, the normal end-of-file action is executed and
the lexical analysis continues as normal-provided that the input is set
appropriately (e.g. a return from an include occured). 

Currently, there are two forms of skippers implemented:

# _Character set skippers_ of the form ''<skip: [ \n\t]>'' which allows to skip 
over wide ranges of characters that belong to a given character set defined in 
'['- and ']'- brackets. The above example shows a skipper that eliminates whitespace
in ASCII. 

# _Range Skippers_ of the form ''<skip_range:  "/*" "*/">''. They allow to skip any
content that is framed by a starting regular expression and an ending string. In the example
above the skipper  skips over traditional C-Language comments.
