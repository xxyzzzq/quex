Section \ref{sec:practical/patterns} already discussed the format of the
pattern file. In this section, it is described how to specify patterns by the
use of regular expressions. The first releases of quex relied solely on a core
that was produced by flex. From version 0.10.0 on quex provides its own core
engine---leaving the flex engine as an option. Versions later then 0.14.0 do
not contain a flex engine anymore since quex produced engines have proven to be much
faster and more efficient. However, For the sake of established habits the
descriptions of regular expressions are kept mostly conform with the world of
lex/flex.  Nevertheless, quex provides features that flex does not. If it is
intended to maintain compatibility of regular expressions with flex, then
please refer to the flex manual \cite{}, section 'Patterns' and do not use
quex-specific constructs. This section discusses pure quex syntax. The
explanation is divided into the consideration of context-free expressions and
context-dependent expressions.
