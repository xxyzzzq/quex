Section \ref{sec:practical/patterns} already discussed the format of the
pattern file. In this section, it is described how to specify patterns by the
use of regular expressions. The first releases of quex relied solely on a
core that was produced by flex. From version 0.10.0 on quex provides its own
core engine---leaving the flex engine as an option. For the sake of established
habits the descriptions of regular expressions are kept mostly conform with the
world of lex/flex.  However, quex provides features that flex does not. If
it is intended to use flex as a core generating engine on the long run, then please refer to
the flex manual \cite{}, section 'Patterns'. This section discusses pure
quex syntax. The explanation is divided into the consideration of
context-free expressions and context-dependent expressions.
