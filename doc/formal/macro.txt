When quex creates a lexical analyser it leaves some switches in the code
that can be turned on and off in order to control certain
charactersistics. First of all, quex makes heavy use of`assert`s to
make sure that the code is executed appropriately. These asserts can be turned
off by defining the`NDEBUG` macro.  The following macros are quex
specific and can be specified with the '-D' option of your compiler:

QUEX_OPTION_LINE_NUMBER_COUNTING::	    
 
  If this macro is defined, then the lexical analyzer class contains support
  for line number counting. This means, that according member functions are
  present and internal related bookkeeping is activated. Note, that activating
  this feature may consume some calculation time. However, the solution for
  number counting provided by quex is likely to beat any user-provided approach.
  Note, that quex is able to analyze regular expressions to the point that it
  tries to determine constant line offsets for a pattern, before the engine actually
  runs.

QUEX_OPTION_COLUMN_NUMBER_COUNTING::	    

  Same as `QUEX_OPTION_LINE_NUMBER_COUNTING` for column number counting.

QUEX_OPTION_RUNTIME_MODE_TRANSITION_CHECK::

  This flag is only interesting if the flag `--no-mode-transition-check` was _not_
  set, i.e. that code for mode-transition check has been produced by quex. This macro
  allows to activate these mode transition checks. Note, that pushing and popping
  of modes requires a run time mode transition check.

QUEX_OPTION_DEBUG_TOKEN_SENDING::
  
  If this option is activated a message is printed each time a token is sent to
  the token queue. Together with a printout of the token after reception with
  `get\_token()` this helps to see if tokens are flushed $$'in time'$$.
  This feature is only available if the engine is produced with the `$$--debug$$`
  flag.

QUEX_OPTION_DEBUG_MODE_TRANSITIONS::

  If defined, the lexical analyser engine displays any mode transition on the
  standard error output.  This feature is only available if the engine is
  produced with the `$$--debug$$` flag.

QUEX_OPTION_DEBUG_QUEX_PATTERN_MATCHES::

  If defined every pattern match is going to be displayed on the standard error
  output.  This feature is only available if the engine is produced with the
  `$$--debug$$` flag.

QUEX_OPTION_INCLUDE_STACK_SUPPORT::

  If enabled, then this macro activates support for the 'include stack', i.e.
  the member functions to switch the input buffer elegantly to parse from 
  included files and return back to the including file.

QUEX_SETTING_BUFFER_SIZE::  

  The internal input buffer size. (DEFAULT = 65536)

QUEX_SETTING_TOKEN_QUEUE_INITIAL_SIZE::  

  The initial size of the token queue. The token queue extends itself if there
  is not enough space to store tokens. However, in order to avoid such memory
  allocations, it might be set to a reasonable number. (DEFAULT = 2048, but
  something like 32 should actually be 'reasonable')
