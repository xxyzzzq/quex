Quex generates a C++ class that implements a lexical analyser as specified
by the user. This section discusses the class members and member functions with
which the user may interacts. Section \ref{sec:formal/generated-class/ui}
discusses the usage of the lexical analyser from outside, i.e. how the end
user of the engine is going to create a lexical analyser and how a character
stream is transformed into a token stream. The subsequent sections discuss how
modes can be handled using member functions, token handling, the_ 
accumulator_, and some virtual functions to be possibly overriden by a derived
class. Any member function can theoretically be used in any
context footnote:[This is, of course, only true as long as acces rights of` 
private` or `public` do not forbid it.].
