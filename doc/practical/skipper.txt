In order to skip partions of the input without considering its content, quex provides
the ability to define so called 'skippers'. Skippers can be used, for example, to
skip whitespaces  and skip comments. Of course, most of the skippers can also be 
defined as patterns that have no action related to it. However, there are great 
advantages of skippers over their implementation as a 'skipping pattern'.

First of all, skippers perform faster, since they only compare against the closing delimiter
while swallowing the input file. Second, they may reduce
the required buffer size. Normally, the buffer size has to be in the range of the
size of the largest possible token. This would include 'skipping' patterns, such 
as patterns eating the '/*' - '*/' type of comments. With skippers would could leave
the buffer size to 64K, even though, comments may be much larger. Finally, the 'nested
skipper' type, allowing nested comments, for example, cannot be implemented as a 
regular expression.
