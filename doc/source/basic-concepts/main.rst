Basic Concepts
**************

This chapter is about concepts and terminology. The discussions setup the the
foundation for the subsequent chapters.  Partly, the discussions partly peek
behind the curtain of what Quex is doing--only for the reader to relax knowing
that Quex deals with the details. 

The first section sheds some light on the inner functioning of an analyzer, as
it is generated by Quex. In the second section the complete food chain is
discussed from the source of data until it reaches the buffer on which an
analyzer operates.  The third section discusses how an analyzer reacts to input
and what output it produces: tokens.  Any analysis of a Quex analyzer happens
in a 'mode'-- a concept which is presented in the last section, together with
the concept of 'incidences'.
