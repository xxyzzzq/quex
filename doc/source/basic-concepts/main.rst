Basic Concepts
**************

This chapter is about concepts and terminology.  Partly, the discussions peek
behind the curtain of what Quex is doing--only for the reader to relax knowing
that Quex deals with the details.  The delivered concepts and terminologies are
the foundation for understanding the subsequent chapters.

The first section sheds some light on the inner functioning of an analyzer, as
it is generated by Quex. In the second section the complete food chain is
discussed from the source of data until it reaches the buffer on which an
analyzer operates.  The third section discusses how an analyzer reacts to input
and what output it produces. It defines the output as a stream of so-called
'tokens'.  Any analysis of a Quex analyzer happens in a 'mode'. This concept is
presented in the last section, together with the concept of 'incidences'.
