Number Format
-------------

Numbers in Quex are specified in a way similar to what is common practice in
many programming languages such as C, Python, Java, etc. -- with some convenient
extensions. Number formats are as follows:

.. describe:: no prefix as in "4711"

    Normal decimal integers do not start with '0' and have none of the 
    prefixes below.

.. describe:: 0x as in "0xC0.FF.EE" or "0x3fea"

    Hexadecimal numbers need to be preceeded by '0x'. The dots inside the
    hexadecimal numbers are meaningless for the parser, but may facilitate
    the reading for the human reader.

.. describe:: 0o as in "0o751"

   Octal numbers are preceeded by '0o'.

.. describe:: 0b as in "0b100.1001"

   Binary numbers are preceeded by '0b'. Again, redundant dots may facilitate
   the human interpretation of the specified number.
   
.. describe :: 0r as in "0rXMVIII" or "0rvii"

   Roman numbers must be preceeded by a '0r' prefix.

.. describe :: 0n as in "0naabdea" or "0nABHJ"

   Napier numbers (location arithmetric) must be preceeded by a '0n' prefix.
