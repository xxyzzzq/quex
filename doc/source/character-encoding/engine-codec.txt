Analyzer Engine Codec
=====================

Apapting the internal codec of the generated lexical analyzer engine happens by
means of the command line flag ``--codec``. When a codec is specified the
internal engine will no longer run on unicode, but rather on the specified
codec. Figure :ref:`<fig-codec-adaption-1>` and :ref:`<fig-codec-adaption-2>`
show an engine in unicode and the adapted engine for the codec ISO8859-7
(Greek).
