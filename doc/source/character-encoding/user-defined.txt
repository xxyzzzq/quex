User Implemented Converters
===========================

For 'normal' applications the provided converters provide enough performance
and a sufficiently low memory footprint. There is no need for the user to
implement special converters. However, it might become interesting when it
comes to tuning.  If someone knows that the UTF-8 encoding mostly reads
characters from a specific code page it is possible to provide an optimized
converter that is able to speed up a bit the total time for lexical analysis.
Also, by means of this feature it is possible to scan personalized encodings. 

Converters can be added to the quex engine very much in a plug-and-play manner.
Nevertheless, this section is considered to be read by advanced users. Also,
the effort required for implementing and testing a dedicated converter might
exceed the time budgets of many projects. Lexical analyzers can be generated
with quex, literally, in minutes. Implementing personalized converters together
with the implementation of unit tests, however, can easily take up a whole week. 

For everyone who is not yet scared off, here comes the explanation: A converter
for a buffer filler is an object that contains the following function pointers
described here in a simplified manner, without precise type definitions:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct QuexConverter {
        void    (*open)(me, FromCodingName, CodingName);  
        bool    (*convert)(me, source, SourceEnd, drain, DrainEnd);
        void    (*on_conversion_discontinuity)(me);       /* optional and can be 0x0 */
        void    (*delete_self)(me);
   };

Each function points to an implementation of a function that interacts the the library
or the algorithm for character conversion. The role of each function is explained in the following list.

.. cfunction:: open(...)

        This opens internally a conversion handle for the conversion from 'FromCodingName'
        to ``ToCodingName``. Pass ``0x0`` as ``ToCodingName`` in order to indicate a conversion
        to unicode of size sizeof(QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER). 
                
        It is the task of the particular implementation to provide the 'to coding'
        which is appropriate for sizeof(QUEX_TYPE_CHARACTER), i.e. ASCII, UCS2, UCS4.
        
        
.. cfunction:: open(...)

        Function ``convert`` tries to convert all characters given in ``source`` with the
        coding specified earlier to _open(...). ``source`` and ``drain`` are passed as
        pointers to pointers so that the pointers can be changed. This way the
        converter can inform the user about the state of conversion from source to
        drain buffer.::
                
                   START:
                                *source              SourceEnd
                                |                    |
                         [      .....................]   source buffer
                
                              *drain         DrainEnd
                              |              |
                         [....               ] drain buffer
                
        At the beginning, 'source' points to the first character to be
        converted. 'drain' points to the place where the first converted
        character is to be written to.::
                 
                   END:
                                                *source                              
                                                |     
                         [                      .....]   source buffer
                
                                       *drain 
                                       |      
                         [.............      ] drain buffer
                
        After convertsion, ``source`` points immediately behind the last 
        character that was subject to conversion. ``drain`` points behind the
        last character that resulted from the conversion. 

        This function must provide the following return values
                 
        .. data:: true    
           
           Drain buffer is filled as much as possible with converted characters.

        .. data:: false    

           More source bytes are needed to fill the drain buffer.     

.. cfunction:: on_conversion_discontinuity(...)    

        The function ``on_conversion_discontinuity`` is called whenever a conversion discontinuity appears.
        Such cases appear only when the user navigates through the input
        stream (seek_character_index(...)), or with long pre-conditions when
        the buffer size is exceeded. 
            
        For 'normal' converters this function can be set to '0x0'. If a converter
        has an internal 'statefulness' that is difficult to be tamed, then use
        this function to reset the converter. Actually, the initial reason
        for introducing the function pointer was the strange behavior of the 
        ICU Converters of IBM(R). Note, that if the function pointer is set, then
        the buffer filler does not use any hints on character index positions. This
        may slow down the seek procedure. If a pre-condition makes it necessary to load
        backwards, or the user navigates arbitrarily in the buffer stream there
        can be significant trade-offs.

.. cfunction:: on_conversion_discontinuity(...)    

        This function closes the conversion handle produced with open(...) and      
        deletes the object of the conversion object, in the same way as a virtual
        constructor does.
