Plotting State Machine Graphs
=============================

For plotting graphs, the graphviz utility must be installed. It can
be downloaded from http://www.graphviz.org. If it still does not 
work as planned, then make sure that the directory where "dot.exe"
is located is inside the global ``PATH`` environment variable. 
Closing all applications that may use quex and reopening them
ensures that the new setting is communicated correctly to quex.
