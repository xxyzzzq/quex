Sections of a Quex Definition File
==================================

The definition of a lexical analyzer to be generated by quex happens 
in several sections. The only section that is mandatory, is the
mode section. No pattern-action pairs can be defined outside a mode
and no lexical analyzer can work without pattern action pairs. The following
list provides an overview about sections that can be defined 
in a source file to be treated by quex:

.. data:: mode

.. data:: header

.. data:: define

.. data:: token

.. data:: body

   Extensions to the lexical analyzer class definition.

.. data:: init

   Extensions to the lexical analyzer constructor.

An initial mode ``START_MODE`` in which the lexical analyzer starts its
analysis can be specified via 

.. code-block:: cpp
   start = START_MODE
