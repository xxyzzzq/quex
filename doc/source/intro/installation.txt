Installation
============

Before beginning the installation of quex, make sure that
Python (http://www.python.org) is installed. Most linux distributions provide
handy rpm packages--so this should not be an issue. 
Once Python is isntalled, follow these steps: 

.. note::

   As for quex version 0.36.5 you cannot use Python version ≥ 3.0. Version 3.0
   is not compatible with the 2.x versions. 

* Extract the file ``quex-x.x.x.tar.gz`` into the desired directory.

* Set the environment variable ``QUEX\_PATH`` in your system
  environment to the place where you installed quex. If you are using
  a Unix system and the bash-shell, add the following line to your
  ``.bashrc``-file: ``export QUEX_PATH=the/directory/where/quex/was/installed/``
  if you installed quex in the directory given on the right hand side of
  the assignment.

* Make a link from the file ``$QUEX_PATH/quex-exe.py`` to
  ``$EXECUTABLE_PATH/quex`` where ``$EXECUTABLE_PATH`` is a path where executables
  can be found by your system.  If you work on a unix system, you can
  type ``ln -s $QUEX_PATH/quex-exe.py /usr/local/bin/quex`` You can
  ensure executable rights with ``chmod a+rx $QUEX_PATH/quex-exe.py``, ``chmod a+rx
  /usr/local/bin/quex``.

* Supply your C\+\+ compiler with the include path '$QUEX_PATH'. For the
  vast majority of compilers this means you must add ``-I$(QUEX_PATH)``
  to the list of compiler flags. An example of how this is done can be observed
  in the test applications which come with the quex distribution.

* If you want to use character set conversion, you need to install one of the
  supported libraries--currently IBM's ICU <http://icu-project.org/userguide/intro.html>
  or GNU IConv <http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/>[#f1]_.


That is all. Now, you should either copy the directories ``./demo/*`` to a
place where you want to work on it, or simply change directory to there.  These
directories contain sample applications 000, 001, $\ldots$. Change to the directory of the
sample applications and type ``make``. If everything is setup properly,
you will get your first quex-made lexical analyser executable in a matter
of seconds. 

.. note::

   It was reported that a certain development environment called 'VisualStudio'
   from a company called 'Microsoft' requires the path to python
   to be set explicitly. Development environments may have their own set
   of variables that need to be adapted.

The example applications depict easy ways to specify
traditional lexical analysers, they show some special features of quex such
as mode transitions, and more. Each demo-application deals with a particular
feature of quex: 

.. data:: demo/000

          shows how to setup a lexical analyzer very quickly.

.. data:: demo/001

          demonstrates basics on modes and mode transitions.

.. data:: demo/002

          contains a sample application for an indentation based language.

.. data:: demo/003

          implements a lexical analyzer handling UTF8 encoding. Quex creates an
          engine that relies on *converters* ICU and IConv. The converters
          are used to convert the incoming data stream to unicode. The internal
          engine still runs on plain unicode code points.

          In contrast, directory demo/011 an example is shown how quex creates
          analyzer engines that do not need converters. The engine itself 
          understands the codec and triggers on its code elements.

.. data:: demo/004

          contains a setup to generate a lexical analyser for the 'C' language.

.. data:: demo/005

          explains how to do lexical analysis with files that include other files.

.. data:: demo/006

          contains an example that treats *pseudo ambiguous post contexts* (or,
          'dangerous trailing contexts) which are difficult to deal with by
          means of traditional lexical analyser generators.

.. data:: demo/007

          examples showing pattern priorization between base and derived modes as well as
          applications of ``PRIORITY-MARK`` and ``DELETION``.

.. data:: demo/008

          shows how a quex generated lexer is linked to a bison generated parser. 

.. data:: demo/009

          shows how analyzers can be implemented for ``char`` and ``wchar_t`` string streams.

.. data:: demo/010

          shows how to access the analyzer's memory buffer directly. It also
          contains an example, ``stdinlexer.cpp``, that shows how to parse the
          standard input (i.e. the ``cin`` or ``stdin`` stream).

.. data:: demo/011

          provides an example of how to adapt the character encoding of the
          lexical analyzer engine without using converters. Example codecs are 
          iso8859-7 and utf8.

.. data:: demo/012

          gives an example of how to use multiple lexical analyzers in one single
          application. 

.. data:: benchmark

          contains a benchmark suite to measure the performance of the lexical
          analyzer. As an example a benchmark for a C-lexer is implemented. The
          suite can build lexical analyzers based on quex, but also as a
          comparison the same analyzers generated by flex and re2c.

The author of this document suggests that the user looks at these sample
applications first before continuing with the remainder of this text.  With the
background of easy-to-use examples to serve as starting point for their own
efforts, it should be natural to get a feeling for the ease of quex.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#f1] If you are glad to work on a Linux system, the probability that your 
         distribution provides pre-configured installation packages for those 
         libraries is very high. Nevertheless, there are also wellness packages for other
         operating systems.
